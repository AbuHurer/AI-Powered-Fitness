1 powerlift per day powerbuilding 5 day bro split,"based off of andy baker's kcs (kingwood strength & conditioning) powerbuilding program.

it focuses on increasing strength on one lift per day, including squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, and pull-up. rest days are after squat and deadlift days.

1 - shoulders & triceps
2 - back
3 - quads & calves
rest
4 - chest & biceps
5 - posterior chain
rest

fit in abs, extra calves & cardio wherever you like.

at some point in a lifter's career, typically after the novice or early intermediate phase, the most reliable way to get stronger is to become more muscular, i.e. build muscle mass. to that end, the term ""powerbuilding"" has emerged to describe a hybrid approach of training the main barbell lifts (like a powerlifter) alongside a selection of supplemental lifts done for higher reps aimed at increasing muscular size (like a bodybuilder). 

while some people knock powerbuilding as merely a clever marketing term, a suboptimal way to train, the fact is that many of the strongest powerlifters of all time have trained with this approach: ed coan, dan green, kirk karwoski, and many others..  this uses gradually decreasing reps like 8/5/2  or 5/4/3 or 6/4/2, whatever you prefer for progressing the main lifts in the context of a five-day body part split.  repeat the 3 week cycle and increase your weight by at least 5 or 10 pounds.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate']","['athletics', 'powerlifting', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,6.0,90.0,237,2025-04-23 09:21:00,2025-06-18 11:55:00,63.0

if you are unable to get through the workout and feel lack of strength or energy don't drop calories.

when workouts become easier add more weights in smaller increments. keep tracking your progress and your food.

sleep for 9 hrs. daily.

thw biggest supplement you need is that of a consistency. because the program is super high volume. hence, i would recommend you to start of with light weights and try to complete all exercises and all sets. and slowly and periodically increase the load.

if your nutrition and sleep remains on point, i can bet that the results will follow.

always remember, to achieve something extraordinary you need to put in extraordinary efforts.

a 2-day per week bodybuilding program with lower volumes and all sets taken to failure. 

by stringing together exercises into giant sets, we can get in some ""free"" cardio while allowing muscles to rest while others are being used and which reduces session length. week 1 will show the template for these giant sets, but the following weeks will list the exercises normally so movements can be moved around as needed.

this leaves 5 days off per week and thus allows a lot of scheduling flexibility as well as days for other activities like cardio and sports (in my case speed work for sprinting and kickboxing).

start with a low weight to get used to the movements, and start at the low end of the rep range e.g. if the range is 3 sets of 8-12 reps, start with 3 sets of 8 reps.

aim to increase reps each week. this is a goal, don't worry if you can't quite do it one week, but really push yourself! 

once you've reached the top end of a rep range (e.g. you can do 12 reps in 3 sets of a 3 set 8-12 rep exercise) then increase the weight slightly and start again at (in the prior example) 3 sets of 8 reps.

3 day baki grappler condensed conjugate,"this program is designed for martial artists who train bjj or mma 4–5 times per week and want to develop a powerful, athletic physique while improving performance on the mat. it uses a condensed conjugate method, blending strength, speed, muscle-building, and functional training into three efficient weekly sessions that respect recovery needs.

program structure

day 1: iron roots
focuses on max effort lower body strength and explosive upper body power. includes a heavy lower body lift, a speed-focused upper body movement, and targeted accessory work.

day 2: steel sinew
focuses on max effort upper body strength and dynamic lower body power. includes a heavy upper body lift, a speed-focused lower body movement, and supporting exercises.

day 3: grappler's gas tank
emphasizes full-body muscle endurance, conditioning, and functional strength. uses circuits, carries, sled work, bodyweight movements, and joint-friendly tools to build resilience and athleticism.

key concepts

max effort and dynamic effort lifts rotate every 2–4 weeks to prevent stagnation and continually challenge the body.

accessories are chosen for functional carryover, including unilateral work, loaded carries, grip training, and core stability.

the third session is flexible, allowing for hypertrophy, conditioning, or general physical preparedness based on the athlete’s needs and martial arts intensity that week.

intensity is managed using rpe (rate of perceived exertion) to ensure recovery and performance on the mats.

after each 4-week block, progress is assessed and main lift variations are changed to address new weaknesses and continue progress.

this program delivers a balanced approach to strength, speed, muscle, and functional athleticism, helping martial artists build a physique and skill set that directly supports their performance in combat sports.","['novice', 'beginner']",['athletics'],garage gym,4.0,60.0,136,2025-06-21 03:01:00,2025-06-21 03:50:00,28.0

each day 2 compounds+abs and 3 isolations.
if you are able to do more than 50 bodyweigth dips and 30 bodyweight pull-ups go weighted on them in the 8-12 rep range.

use double progression 
ex.:
bench press 2x6-10

10kg for 10    10kg for 10      12kg for 9     12kg for 10
10kg for 9     10kg for 11       12kg for 8     12kg for 10

the last set on every lift must be to acutal muscular failure.
even if you go over the rep range just adjust the weigths next week.

only do 2 sets for all lifts. you might want to up the sets to 3 but you should be able to make progress on 2 sets each.
only do more when you need to.
if you run into a platue where you have not added a rep in 3 weeks add a set to this excercise.

abs need to be trained and progressed on if you want a good core.

the compounds do not overlap in muscles worked so superset them you wont lose performance on either lift. same goes for isolation.

3 times fullbody workout,"hey,

so last year i became a dad and don't get me wrong it was and is the best thing ever happened in my life. but as soon as you get to know how much time and energy flows into being a good father, you recognize that you can't live your life as befor. long story short, i always went 5 to 6 days per week into the gym but nowadays this seems impossible, so i bought myself a homegym and created a plan i could stick to while being there for my job and my family. 

this plan is for all of you out there who want to kick there ass in the gym/homegym and still have enough time for everything else.

the plan looks like this:

-alternated fullbody workout 
-3 times a week
-after every workout there needs to be at least one restday 
-perfect would be monday/wedneysday/friday but you could also do monday/thursday/saturday etc.
-you will take all sets very hard and pushing to the limit but the last set of every exercise should really be to reach failure no reps in reserve!
-you can run this plan in a normal gym but also in a homegym with not so much equipment needed.
- rest time between sets: i would recommend between 60 and 120 seconds. 120 for exercises like benchpress/squats/deadlift...90 seconds for lat pulldown/rows/military press and 60 seconds for isolation exercises biceps/calves etc.
-progression: when you manage to get all sets of an exercise with the highest amount of reps you add some weight for next workout and so on. for example:

benchpress 90 kg x 8/8/8/8 >>>next workout 92,5 kg x 8/8/7/6 (you stick to the weight until reaching 8 reps in every set)

when the 12 weeks are over i would recommend doing one week of rest. and then starting over again or change some exercises if you want and focuse more on weakpoints.

- progressive overload is a must, try to increase weight every week on most exercises, and if unable to, increase reps and/or sets.
- bodyweight exercises should be substituted for weighted variants when possible, such as with dips.

training abs
- abs aren't included in this split because it is entirely up to preference when they should be included. vacuums should be practiced daily but abs should be performed either every session or every second session depending on soreness and other factors.","['novice', 'intermediate']","['powerbuilding', 'powerlifting', 'bodyweight fitness', 'bodybuilding', 'athletics']",full gym,12.0,120.0,288,2024-07-23 09:08:00,2025-06-18 09:05:00,168.0

4 day hypertrophy program (upper body focus),"this is a program for a lifter who has 4 days to dedicate to the gym, and wants to focus on upper body development. you will still grow everywhere, the volume has just been shifted toward upper body. please read the full program guide i’ve  written. if you have any more question after you’ve read through you can dm on instagram @ thedamianzepeda. 

to start the program i would highly recommend you take 1 set off each exercise for the first 1-2 weeks, otherwise you’ll likely be really sore. 

this program uses a basic double progression. the way i run a double progression you have a set and rep range, and you progress the weight when you hit the top of rep range for all sets. for example you have 3 sets of 5-8 reps (3x5-8) each week you add reps until 3x8 with that weight. then you increase the weight and start back at the bottom and do it over again. it’s that simple do not over think this ! 

also don’t worry too much about the rpe ranges. if you are progressing over time even if you start off training too easy over time you will be training hard enough.  if you go into a session feeling super beat up you can reduce the sets by 1-2 and the weight by 15-20 % and go back to regular training the next workout. just make sure you’re being honest with your self and not abusing it because you don’t like training hard. also once this program is completed i would recommend you go to a more balanced program rather than continuing to run an upper body focused program. best of luck !","['novice', 'intermediate']","['athletics', 'bodybuilding']",full gym,12.0,80.0,552,2025-06-23 07:57:00,2025-06-25 04:44:00,112.0
4 day maximum mass workout,"overload
overload is critical to the muscle building process. push each set for the maximum number of reps, stopping that set either when you feel your form is slipping, or if you feel like you may fail on the next rep. do not train to failure. the point is to stimulate growth, not annihilate your body and central nervous system.

add weight to each exercise as frequently as possible, when it makes sense. i recommend using the same weight for every set of a given exercise, and when you are able to perform a comfortable number of reps on each set, add weight.

rep ranges
rep ranges are simply a guideline. it's is ok to go over them, or a hair under at times. again, the magic is overload. rep ranges are simply a tool.

5 minute burn periods
for each body part you will perform a 5 minute burn out period. these sets are brutal. pick a weight that allows you to perform about 12-15 reps. over a 5 minute period you perform as many reps as possible with that weight, starting and stopping sets as needed. rest only long enough to catch your bearings and breathe, and then start knowing out more reps.

5 minute burn out periods are not about sets and reps. they are about finishing off an already fatigued muscle. don't obsess (or even count)  over how many total sets you do. instead, try to do as many reps as possible in 5 minutes using whatever rest periods you need to survive.",['intermediate'],['bodybuilding'],full gym,8.0,60.0,272,2025-01-30 11:52:00,2025-06-18 12:19:00,56.0

week progression plan
	•	weeks 1-8: stick to core exercises with linear weight progression and focus on mastering tempo and range of motion.
	•	weeks 9-16: introduce variations (e.g., incline/decline bench, unilateral movements), increase volume, and incorporate advanced techniques for challenge and growth.

key adjustments from weeks 1-8 that will be seen in weeks 9-16:

✅ drop sets & amrap – to increase intensity.
✅ tempo manipulation – slow negatives and pauses to increase tension.

"5/3/1 ""dungeon booty vixen""","it's a variation of the popular 5/3/1 routine, tailored specifically for female athletes. this program focuses on overall strength while also incorporating hypertrophy elements for legs and glutes. our inside joke is to try and emulate the physique of '80s sword and sorcery movie stars. you could call it a ""powerbuilder"" or old-school routine.

*** instructions ***


- in 5/3/1, there's a value used to calculate the weights called the ""training max"" (we'll call it tm from now on). this is a percentage of your one-rep max (1rm) for a specific exercise. in this variation, you use 80% or 85% of your 1rm, but it's recommended to start with 80%.
for example, if your 1rm for squats is 100 kg, you'd do 100 x 0.80 = 80 kg. so, 80 kg is your tm. 

- all the variations (like push press, rdl, front squat, and paused bench press) use the same tm as their main exercise (e.g., push press uses the same tm as standing press). the difficulty of these variations is already factored in.

- in the boostcamp app, you need to enter the tms for the variations manually. remember, they're exactly the same as the main exercise.

- the last set of the first exercise is always an amrap. complete the required reps plus as many extra reps as you can.

for example, on day one of week one, you should do at least 5 reps plus any extra reps you can manage.

- rpe stands for rate of perceived exertion, which is a scale used to measure the intensity of an exercise based on how hard it feels to the individual. for example, if you are doing a set of 12 reps at rpe6, it means you are working at an intensity where you feel you could do 4 - 6 more reps before reaching failure. 

-progressing accessories with rpe involves gradually increasing the weight or reps while keeping the same rpe level, ensuring consistent challenge and adaptation without overexertion.

- rpe is not fixed and can vary from day to day depending on factors like fatigue, stress, and overall condition. it's important to understand that a weight that feels like rpe8 one day might feel like rpe6 on another day. this variability highlights the importance of autoregulation, which means adjusting your training intensity based on how you feel each session. by doing this, you can ensure you're working at an appropriate intensity and avoid overtraining or undertraining

- after completing the 3-week cycle, run the routine again, adding 2.5 kg to upper body lifts and 5 kg to lower body lifts. for example, if you squat 100kg, enter 80kg as your tm. after 3 weeks, use a tm of 85kg. if the last cycle feels really heavy add 1.25 and 2.5 instead


- deload after 6 weeks (see week 4)


- aim for a clean calorie surplus.

- try to complete at least 3 cycles of 6 weeks each.

- start light.

- light cardio on rest days is fine.","['novice', 'beginner']",['muscle & sculpting'],full gym,3.0,60.0,59,2024-07-23 01:12:00,2025-06-26 12:36:00,21.0

5/3/1 - powerbuilder edition,"this is a 5/3/1 variation that i have designed.

please use a 85% training max (tm) not a true 1rm.
when the app prompts a 1rm only put 85% of that 1rm. if my 1 rep max on bench is 160kg then i put 136kg in the 1rm request.

this is not for beginners - please see 5/3/1 for beginners or starting strength.

i built this with ""power-building"" in mind, taking some concepts from 5/3/1 and building something i personally aim to follow. as a result it may not be the ideal program for your needs but feel free to edit more specific to your goals.

i have set it up to run for 3 weeks, you then increase your tm as per 5/3/1 guidance or take a deload week (which is not programmed) and then rerun it.

accessories have been chosen for my needs so adjust accordingly. there's nothing magic about this program. i am also running a mini experiment of all accessory work being within 2-3 x 5-12. heavier load, lower volume, higher intensity overall.

you will do 2 main lifts per session with gpp/bodybuilding volume work in an upper/lower split. all muscles will be hit 2x per week with sufficient volume for growth. sessions will follow: amrap for main lift, then volume work for mirrored main lift (deadlift/squat & bench/ohp) followed by the gpp/bodybuilding work, as mentioned.

5/3/1 also programs in jumps and throws - i highly recommend you do them - but understand they are not mandatory.

i haven't programmed any conditioning so follow 5/3/1 guidelines for this. i would say: 2-4 easy sessions and 1-2 hard sessions per week. you can adjust per your needs and ability but don't be the lifter who skips conditioning work - ""the better conditioned lifter always wins"".

for accessory work: do what you feel you can handle, train hard but don't go overboard. the worst thing you can do when in a hole is keep digging.

i am doing a little experiment as i mentioned. this is just for me to see how i react to a heavier load, lower rep style work. i have recently been doing a rp (renaissance periodisation) style of large ranges, pushing reps high with lower load etc and i want to switch it up. you could still do that style here but that is why i have written it this way.

as its 4x per week you can run it as: 
a. on off repeat, 
b. 2 on 1 off 2 on 2 off, 
c. 2 on 1 off repeat. 

other recommendations:
1. super-set as much as you'd like so long as it makes sense. throw in ab work or pair two exercises together that don't interfere with one another i.e. bicep and triceps work.
2. don't overthink it - just do the work and move on.
3. do your conditioning - 20-30 mins steady state counts but also do something that challenges you i.e. prowler, cross fit conditioning wod whatever - again see point 2.","['intermediate', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'novice']","['powerlifting', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,3.0,70.0,87,2024-11-05 03:27:00,2025-06-18 10:46:00,24.5

85% training max

the main movement stays the same and keeps strength in the program. this allows you to progress from week to week and actually get stronger, something lacking in about 99% of non-assisted bodybuilders' routines.
when you push the assistance in the program below, keep the reps on the final set to just the bare minimum or just slightly over.
for conditioning, i highly recommend 30-40 minutes of walking every day. yes,  walking. if you're asking why something so non-strenuous: if physique goals are your only concern, do not let the conditioning take away from your recovery.

unequal frequency for an equal physique. for those who find their upper body recovers quicker than their lower body and for superset enjoyers. an upper/lower split with an emphasis on the upper body. also, side delts are on leg days to allow for more superset flexibility and to decrease time on upper body days. feel free to slot another muscle group to leg day if you'd rather train side delts 3x a week and find that muscle doesn't affect performance on upper body days. i'd recommend arms or shoulders

the exercises are what i personally do due to the layout of my gym and what i have available. if anyone actually runs this, feel free to change around the movements for what you have/like. start with a lower volume and add more in later. better to start with less and add more later-especially with a 3x a week upper body frequency.

"8x8, but quick…","novice friendly program, geared towards aesthetics, but with linear progression applied to also increase strength. this program is intended for busy people who may not be able to devote enough time for 5 or more weight/lifting workouts, on top of getting their base steps/activity and cardio in. 

the program is divided into horizontal upper, vertical upper, legs. this way you are working both push and pull in each upper workout, to maintain a little more balance.

the “base” lifts are structured in 8x8 style (ala vince gironda).. for these lifts, pick a starting weight around 60% of your 1rm, or what you could do for a solid set of 12. then, only rest 30-45sec between sets. done properly this can be a solid cardio stimulation.

the accessory lifts are done in more traditional 3x12-15.

guillotine press is there as this is vince gironda inspired, but it is by no means required. you can substitute regular bench, or any horizontal press variation. you do you, whatever gives you the best chest stimulation/connection.

the bodyweight pull-ups can definitely be regressed as needed. work up to 8x8,  8x2/3/4 is still worthwhile, even negatives or substituting lat pulldowns instead. whatever feels best, and allows you to get a good workout in.

gironda was not a fan of heavy back squats, but they work. so pick whichever squat variation feels the best to you (be it low bar, high bar, front, hack, or sissy). i like front for the quad emphasis , but again, you do you.

all that said, feel free to substitute any exercise, as long as it’s a similar movement pattern. whatever floats your boat.

a/b/a alpha over 40,"for men over 40 who want to build muscle efficiently without wasting time in the gym.

this is not another ""bro split."" it’s a science-backed, minimalist approach to muscle growth, designed for real life where time, recovery, and results matter.  

who this is for:
✔ busy professionals who can’t live in the gym but still want to look like they do.  
✔ natural lifters (especially 40+) who need smarter recovery.  
✔ former athletes or intermediate lifters stuck in progress plateaus.  
✔ anyone tired of high-volume programs that leave them burned out, not bigger.  

what it delivers:
1. max muscle in minimal time
   - only 3 workouts/week (a/b/a rotation).  
   - no filler—every set is engineered for growth.

2. age-proof recovery
   - built-in deloads every 6 weeks to prevent burnout.  
   - prioritizes joint-friendly exercises (no ego lifts).  

3. progressive overload made simple
   - reverse pyramid training (rpt): lift heavier, not longer.  
   - myo-reps: more growth in fewer sets.  

4. aesthetic focus
   - targets the “hollywood physique"" (wide shoulders, thick back, lean waist).  
   - balances muscle groups to avoid imbalances.  

what it’s not:
❌ a 6-day ""more is better"" bro split (wastes time).  
❌ a powerlifting program (not chasing 1-rep maxes).  
❌ a quick fix (this is a sustainable, long-term system).  

why it works: 
- less volume, more intensity = better recovery, better gains.  
- 2x weekly muscle stimulus (optimal for naturals).  
- no guesswork - clear progression rules.  

bottom line: this program is for serious lifters who value efficiency. if you want to look jacked without living in the gym this is your blueprint.",['intermediate'],"['bodybuilding', 'powerbuilding', 'muscle & sculpting', 'bodyweight fitness']",garage gym,12.0,60.0,198,2025-04-20 09:51:00,2025-06-18 10:29:00,84.0

absolute athlete (+hypertrophy),"a 3-day program designed to increase your strength in a 7 week cycle, where you increase your training maxes in a timesaving manner. before doing this, have experience with beginner powerlifting programs and have developed some proper strength in sbd. 

## if you want to join, read the following (important) ##

- training
usually i take my prs and subtract it by 5-10kg and input that as my tm. yes, it'll seem low and you will ""reattempt a pr"" on the final week, but it is to ensure linear-progression and to not over-estimate it, but you will get a new pr after the first cycle. week 6 you attempt a pr and week 7 is a deload. read the text above the exercises too, that is critical.

- accessories
this also has accessory movements, each which can be substituted as long as it targets the same muscle group. accessories aren't mandatory, and can be replaced with anything you like that fits your goals (cardio, sparring, etc.).

- muscle focus
main focuses outside of strength in sbd are higher focus on chest and quads; benching and squatting twice a week. singles should always be a pause-lift/explosive- lift, and others are controlled (tap-and-go) movements.

advanced girlboss! hlm 3x full body,"the continuation of the intermediate girlboss program.

rules:
you need to be at least late intermediate to run this program.
!! only run this program when the intermediate program stops working and:
a) you have tried bulking up and still don't progressively overload
b) you have tried upping your protein intake and still do not progressively overload.

rest periods on the heavy and medium days are 2-3mins, supersets are mandatory pretty much.
light day rest periods are 1-1.5mins and supersets are not mandatory as the rest periods make it shorter.

this program is designed with the female body in mind. it is structured with the heavy light medium system to maximise useful volume and frequency, minimise joint fatigue and optimise hypertrophy. 

in order for a fullbody program to work variety is essential.
so we vary the exercises, the reps and also the rest periods.

heavy days = heavy compounds, low reps, long rest
light days= isolations (for joint health and recovery), high reps, short rest
medium days = medium compounds (hypertrophy focused and more joint friendly than the ones on the h day), medium reps, medium rest.

if you change things around the whole system falls apart.
it's a brutally effective system to sculpt your dream body.

it's a constant work in progress.

"advanced upper lower(shoulders, lats, and triceps)","my ideologies have changed from the last program that i have posted. the last program that i made is instead for those that are beginners in the gym and can be run until the novice/intermediate stage, but there will be a plateau that is fatigue induced. i would then recommend that you take a deload(2-3 days off) then do this split which maximizes frequency to allow your muscles to be hit as soon as they are recovered. the reason for why all sets are 1-2 in this program is because as you are increasing frequency, you must decrease the volume per session. also, since you are more advanced, you will get fatigued more from sets.

this is a high frequency upper/lower ~2.5x a week program which does not need you to be in a surplus, and i would recommend that you stay at maintenance calories or be in a very minimal surplus(maingaining/lean bulk).this is because when you are more advanced and you go into a larger surplus, most of it will be fat since you produce muscle at a slower rate as you are more experienced. you should also expect progressive overload every few sessions(1-3 sessions) unless you are very advanced where you should be seeing progress every 3-5 sessions.

upper
lower
rest 
repeat

reasoning behind exercise selection on upper day:

-shoulder press is first to give the front delts and lateral delts priority as the first exercise
-wide grip lat pulldown is second exercise as priority and 2 sets for emphasis on the lower lats since it greatly impacts a physique
-single arm tricep extension is used since you get more motor unit recruitment when going unilateral and there are 2 sets for this also since it is high priority
- due to the triceps fatigue from the extension, we use a single joint chest movement which will be a pec deck fly
-single arm lat row(preferably extra stability from something like a chest support) with same reasoning as the tricep extension, also 1 set since the lats are hit heavily from the wide grip lat pulldown
-the lateral raise should be done with a cuff and unilateral for the same reasoning as provided before
-wide grip chest supported row with 2 sets since this will be the only movement that hits the rear delts heavily out of the rowing variants in the upper day and great for traps
-dumbbell preacher curl since it loads the biceps where it has best leverage 
-then we do a seated hammer curl to finish off the rest of the elbow flexors while decreasing the involvement of the biceps in the movement


reasoning behind exercise selection on lower day:

-start off with the adductor machine since i believe that they have a great impact on the leg appearance
-then move onto a leg extension since it is harder to shorten a muscle further out into a workout and it also warms up the knee joint great
-back extension is for hamstrings, glutes, adductors, and spinal erectors. mainly hamstring movement with distal hypertrophy
-smith machine squat finishes off the quads(focus of vasti muscles)
-hamstring curl hits the short head.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate', 'advanced']","['powerbuilding', 'bodybuilding', 'powerlifting', 'muscle & sculpting']",full gym,12.0,80.0,336,2024-10-15 07:13:00,2025-06-18 07:51:00,112.0

aesthetic hypertrophy for the natural lifter,"full body high frequency size gains for the intermediate lifter. 

prior to the existence of ped’s most natural lifters opted for a high frequency full body approach to training. unafraid of volume and unafraid of training most lifters used compound lifts multiple days per week to activate protein synthesis and hit a muscle multiple times per week. of course, we can bring back this methodology of training while taking advantage of the luxuries at our disposal like machines and incorporate them within our training.

for a natural lifter it’s important to signal protein synthesis as often as possible. 

to make the most of optimal gains we must work with both volume and intensity hand in hand. to be able to work with high volume we must work up to it slowly or we’ll be burnt out. once we work up with your volume, we can bring back intensity to squeeze the best gains we can achieve. 

we work with underloaded movements that are great for developing the most muscle within our body as our main movements. week by week we load these movements with a little bit more volume, a little more intensity and little more weight. 

accessories follow a pyramid progression of weight and intensity.

supersets add crucial volume and effort to our workouts while saving time.


follow rpe prescriptions 1st and foremost and attempt to match reps closely. whenever reps are lowered assume weight is increased. 

this program is meant to be repeated 3 times after finishing, the first week acting as a deload.

use lighter weights then you would usually do for the 1st week.

questions: 
why high frequency?
high frequency training can aid in more quality sets throughout the week. take this in your mind. is the last 5 sets of a 10 set back day as clean or as unfatigued as the first 5 sets? breaking up the volume of a high set day and sprinkling it throughout the week is a good way to get more high quality work. 

we also activate protein synthesis in our body constantly as we do this. 



who should try this program?
natural lifters who usually work with failure or intensity techniques who wish to grow size but try something different. while there’s a hint of a strength component regarding weight gets increased as rpe goes up, this is not a strength program.

why not go to failure on every lift?

-if you have not used volume as a driver for growth, you will understand that attempting to go to failure and beyond on every set is only a method for the advanced. studies show that growth occurs within 3-0 reps to failure. 

why do only some lifts go to failure and not others? 

-safety concerns, and also for convenience. for any rowing or back exercise like the good morning to go to rpe 10, past failure there is a risk to the low back. to compensate for the risk, we add volume so we can get the stimulus we would have had.
time concerns are also a matter regarding going to rpe 10 on something like bench press, where you might need to grab a spotter for 5 sets to truly achieve rpe 10",['beginner'],['bodybuilding'],full gym,4.0,70.0,116,2024-03-01 06:16:00,2025-06-18 10:19:00,32.666666666666664

aesthetics anonymous,"high intensity, moderate volume, moderate frequency bodybuilding program targeted at intermediate lifters.

the transition from novice to intermediate necessitates increased frequency, intensity and volume due to reduced training sensitivity. 

this program aims to maximize muscle hypertrophy while prioritizing recovery and variation so as to minimize risk of injury.

for novice lifters, simply halve the frequency of intensity techniques (rest-pause, drop sets, etc.) and remove the following exercises:

diagonal pulldown/pullovers
incline/flat machine chest press
leg extension

as novices do not require that much volume to maximize hypertrophy, making this junk volume.

for advanced lifters, add 3-4 sets of the following movement patterns:

t-bar row, superset with smith machine jm press
incline curls, superset with seated leg curls
rope face pull, superset with dumbbell chest fly

and add 1-2 sets on the following lifts:

weighted pullup
diagonal pulldown/pullover
cuffed cable lateral raise
behind-the-neck press
high bar back squat
barbell front squat
seated calf raise

as the program proper does not contain sufficient volume for advanced lifters.

if in the late stages of a fat-loss phase, reducing volume by one set on 4-set lifts can be beneficial. 

if possible, incorporate 15-75 minutes of vigorous, low-impact cardio after each workout, staying on the low end if bulking and on the high end if cutting. whether cutting or bulking, cardio can improve work capacity, recovery and potentially increase hypertrophy in the long-term.

rpe and rir tend to be very loosely-defined terms. for the purposes of this program, rpe will be defined relative to true muscular failure, while rir will be relative to technical failure.

true muscular failure is defined as the inability of the muscle to perform the motion under reasonable load.

technical failure is defined as the inability to complete an additional rep with the same form and load as the prior reps in the set.

as true muscular failure is asymptotic, an rpe 10 will be defined as a reasonably close estimation of true muscular failure. an example of an rpe 10 would be arriving at technical failure, then performing cheated concentrics and controlled eccentrics to failure, followed by two drop sets.

rpe 9.5 will be defined as very close to true muscular failure, incorporating at least 1 intensity technique to push past technical failure.

rpe 9 will mean technical failure and/or 0 rir.

0 rir occurs when the lifter has successfully completed one rep and judges that they are unable to complete one more with proper form. an example of a set taken to 0 rir would be re-racking the bar after a five-second grinder on the bench press or squat without attempting an additional rep that would certainly result in failure.","['intermediate', 'advanced']","['bodybuilding', 'powerlifting', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,12.0,90.0,288,2024-04-11 07:35:00,2025-06-18 11:14:00,126.0

• day 2: legs resistance training (monday)
• day 3: heat & cold/recovery (tuesday)
• day 4: torso & neck resistance training (wednesday)
• day 5: cardiovascular training (thursdsay)
• day 6: high intensity interval training (friday)
• day 7: arms, neck & calves training (saturday)

the resistance training days are 4 days per week, starting with 4 weeks of heavier weights at lower rep ranges (schedule a), then shifts to 4 weeks of moderate-lighter weights at higher rep ranges (schedule b). repeat the program for as many cycles as you prefer.

andrew huberman's muscle-building protocol focuses on leveraging the connection between the nervous system and muscles to maximize growth. by understanding how muscles respond to stimuli, huberman designed a workout routine that emphasizes contraction intensity, appropriate weights, and volume to optimize hypertrophy.

traditional training approaches to muscle growth (hypertrophy) often overlook the role of the nervous system in controlling muscle function. huberman's protocol addresses this gap by prioritizing techniques that directly influence neural signaling for muscle growth.

mind muscle connection: instead of solely focusing on lifting maximal weights, emphasis is placed on contracting the muscle as intensely as possible, akin to inducing a cramp-like sensation.

optimal weight range: using weights ranging from 30% to 80% of one's one-rep max (1rm), ensuring the intensity of contraction is paramount rather than the weight lifted.

volume: performing 5 to 15 sets per muscle group per week, with an emphasis on reaching failure or close to it by the end of each set.

warm-up: wenning warm-ups are recommended for 3x25; do not go heavy on the warm-ups. 

perform olympic lifts only if you can do it properly. also, you can replace the regular compound lifts (compounds lift day 1 or day 2) with olympic lifts.

if you want to add accessories exercises for the biceps, delts, calves, etc, replace one of the rest days for an accessories day. the exercises for 3x12-15, myro reps, seth set, or rest pause

apology to myself (shredding edition),"this program is designed to improve overall physical fitness, focusing on endurance, muscle strength, and fat burning. it also promotes a sense of comfort and confidence in your body through a balanced mix of cardio, core strengthening, and stretching exercises.

in addition to following this workout plan, it’s essential to focus on three key areas for optimal results:
	1.	maintain a calorie deficit (500 kcal).
	2.	ensure protein intake is twice your body weight in grams.(other values, such as carbohydrates and fats, are less important)
	3.	get adequate sleep and maintain strong mental focus.

these factors are crucial because the program is highly challenging and will push your body to its limits. the physical and mental demands are significant, making these three points essential for sustained progress and recovery. 

additional tips: it’s beneficial to complement the program with supplements such as creatine and collagen, and to drink at least 4 liters of water per day.","['intermediate', 'novice', 'advanced']",['bodybuilding'],full gym,8.0,80.0,308,2024-11-09 06:51:00,2025-06-18 09:07:00,74.66666666666667
archē,"program overview
this program is designed to build a solid foundation in both cardiovascular fitness and strength, setting the stage for more specific training in the future. after week 8, re-test your 1-rep max (1rm) and use those numbers for the next program such as odysseus, theseus, minotaur, or heracles.

weekly structure
1. strength & core (s&c) — 2x/week
•	focus: compound lifts followed by a core circuit to build a strong, resilient chassis.
•	intensity: based on your 1-rep max (1rm) for each compound lift. determine your 1rm before starting the program.
•	rest:
o	3–5 minutes between compound lift sets
o	2 minutes between core circuit rounds

2. muscular endurance (me) — 1x/week
•	focus: full-body circuit training to develop muscular endurance.
•	rest: 2 minutes between circuits

3. endurance training — 3x/week (e + lsse)
maintain a zone 3 heart rate using your preferred modality: running, swimming, biking, rowing, or rucking.
•	endurance (e) — 2 sessions/week
o	start at 30 minutes in week 1
o	progress to 60 minutes by week 5
o	personal preference: running

•	long steady state endurance (lsse) — 1 session/week
o	duration: 30 to 120 minutes, depending on your fitness level
o	personal preference: rucking

•	high-intensity conditioning (hic) — 2 sessions/week (weeks 6–8 only)
o	short, intense cardio bursts designed to improve vo2 max and anaerobic capacity.

4. rest or active recovery — 1x/week
•	engage in light activity such as walking, hiking, biking, recreational sports, or family outings.

weekly schedule
day	/ session type
day 1	strength & core (s&c)
day 2	endurance (e)
day 3	endurance (e)
day 4	strength & core (s&c)
day 5	muscular endurance (me)
day 6	long steady state endurance (lsse)
day 7	rest or light activity

warm-up guidelines
•	start every session with a general warm-up (e.g., dynamic stretching, light cardio).
•	for strength days:
o	perform warm-up sets of your main lifts, gradually increasing weight.
o	keep rest between warm-up sets short.
o	rest 3-5min before your first working set.

key principles
•	consistency is key:
stick closely to the weekly schedule. if you miss a session, simply continue with the next one. avoid skipping ahead or doubling up.

this program draws heavily from tactical barbell training principles. tactical barbell is an excellent resource for those interested in efficient, goal-oriented training and is highly recommended for further reading",['intermediate'],"['bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",garage gym,8.0,90.0,176,2025-04-29 05:37:00,2025-06-18 08:14:00,84.0
arise - train like sung jin-woo (solo leveling),"sung jin-woo, at first a weak e-rank hunter who is trying to pay the hospital bills for his mother, but e-rank hunters barely earn a living. one destined day he enters a special dungeon where he essential dies & gets ""reborn"" as a ""player"" for the system. he is now able to level up & become stronger, something the other hunters cannot. he evenetually becomes s+ rank through consistency, hard-work & focus on all aspects of what he lacks.
it's now time for you to arise! to your true level.

this program will take it's roots in pha (peripheral heat action) training.
it is similar to supersetting, but focuses on minimizing rest time while alternating between upper & lower-body exercises.

your rest between sets/intervals should be short, but long enough to ensure that you aren't too cardiovascular fatiqued, so it would affect your ability to push your muscles close to failure.

this way will save you time and keep your heart-rate elvated, resulting in a cardiovascular benefit while improving strength at the same time.

here's how to do it:
1. perform one set of your first movement
2. rest as little as possible
3. perform on set of your second movement
4. rest as little as possible

repeat this process until you’ve completed all your sets.
the process is the same when there are three exercises in a group, you simple go through 1 set of all 3 exercises, then back to the first and repeat, till all sets are done. 
you will alternate between the three exercises with minimal rest in
between each, ensuring that you maximize both time efficiency and cardiovascular benefits.

""important note about rep speed- for all the movements in this program, perform the
concentric portion (the phase when the active muscles are shortening) explosively, with the
intent of moving the weight quickly. this approach maximizes muscle motor unit recruitment,
leading to faster rates of strength development.
the eccentric portion of each movement (the phase when the active muscles are
lengthening) is crucial for building muscle. during this phase, focus on controlling the weight
at a slow tempo, taking about 2-3 seconds for each eccentric phase, and aim to get a good
stretch in the active muscles.""

explanation of concentrics & eccentrics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t00u5lmwawq

this program will be 4 workout days (third one with some mobility) + 1 day for mobility & cardio (which can simply be walking)
if you are pressed for time or this is too much for you, at your current level, you can simply swap out the third workout day with the mobility & cardio day. it should be the third day, to minimize rest time between your strenght training to the next strength training.

make sure to do between 5-10 min of warmup. if you do not know where to start, i recommend finding a full-body warm-up routine on youtube, to simply follow before every workout.

bodybuilding & hypertrophy — 6 day split,"hybrid bodybuilding & hypertrophy — 6 day split is a full-scale, year-round bodybuilding and hypertrophy program designed for serious lifters.
this plan combines the best elements of traditional bodybuilding with modern hypertrophy science.
you'll train 6 days per week following a push / pull / legs (ppl) structure. each muscle group is trained twice per week — one day with a strength and compound lift focus, and one day with volume and isolation work to fully target all fibers and weak points.
the program delivers consistent gains in muscle mass, balanced proportions, and strength without seasonal cycles or unnecessary phases. it’s built for long-term growth.

program goals:
-maximize hypertrophy (muscle growth)
-build balanced, aesthetic proportions
-progressive overload of strength to support hypertrophy
-controlled training volume and intensity for sustainable gains

why choose this plan?
-hybrid structure blending classic bodybuilding and modern hypertrophy principles
 -2x/week frequency for optimal growth stimulus
 -exercise variety to minimize plateaus and target weak points
 -smart volume progression to avoid overtraining
 -year-round system — no need for seasonal adjustments

 training guidelines:
-perfect technique always comes before heavy weight.
-progress weekly — add weight (+2.5 to 5 kg) or reps (+1-2) each week.
-maintain 1-2 reps in reserve (rir 1-2), especially on compound lifts.
-every 8-10 weeks take a deload week (reduce load and volume by ~50%).
-and don't forget to sleep minimum 7–8 hours :)

who is this plan for?
-intermediate to advanced lifters
-anyone with access to a full gym setup (commercial or well-equipped home gym)
-athletes focused on long-term muscle growth, aesthetics, and hypertrophy

bro x ppl,"this programs aims to train every muscle group twice per week with 1 day of resting and 1 day of legs. you could run either bro (back - chest - arms), day off and ppl (push - pull - legs) or ppl first, day off and then the bro part. every training day should be no longer than 50mins, leaving enough room in the day of cardio if you wish so.

this program is based on the fallowing principles: 
1. always train the muscle given at the full rom (range of motion) with big emphasis on the lengthen, eccentric, part of the movement.  
2. do not ego lift! use a proper weight so you can do the full rom of 8-12 reps, after that you can do half reps if you wish so until failure.
3. slowly control the weight on the concentric part. do not throw the weight around!  and slowly control the weight on the eccentric part as well, feel the muscle lengthening and tearing apart while you lower the weight.

baki aesthetics - 4 day split x2,"intermediate program focused on the baki aesthetic.  
focused on: arms, chest, upper back, forearms and calves.
this program assumes you have lifted consistently before and can competently perform basic strength exercises and calisthenics.
this program also assumes that you have developed lats(10+ pullups), shoulders(135 ohp), and posterior chain(315 deadlifts) enough to take some focus away from them, or train them for strength instead.  if you want to increase volume for these groups, you can.
days 1&5 are chest and back
days 2&6 are legs
days 3&7 are arms
days 4&8 are accessories- if you want or need to do cardio, this is the best day for that.
i would advise focusing on intensity, making sure you can perform the recommended amount of sets at at least 9 rpe before progressing in weight.
make sure to warm up!!  i haven’t included warmup sets in the programs but you must warmup before your first set of that muscle of the workout.  an injury is the worst thing you can do for progress.
the program is 8 weeks long mostly because that is what i had to do to get an 8 day cycle to fit evenly in weeks.  there is no reason for you not to repeat after the 8 weeks if you want. (a deload week isn’t needed but if you want a mental break go for it.)
i would recommend going light the first week, staying at rpe 8 or below to make sure you know the proper form for each exercise and to help you judge which weights to use next week.",['intermediate'],['powerbuilding'],full gym,8.0,60.0,266,2023-12-30 11:08:00,2025-06-22 06:05:00,56.0

baki builder,"the baki program’s purpose is to develop a body that’s both powerful and agile by prioritizing strength, endurance, flexibility, and explosive power. the program is structured in phases:

1. foundation phase (weeks 1-4):

	•	build fundamental strength, focus on mastering form, and enhance mobility.

2. power phase (weeks 5-8):

	•	increase explosive power with compound lifts and functional movements, while focusing on speed and precision.

3. endurance phase (weeks 9-12):

	•	push stamina limits with high-rep sets, agility drills, and extended cardio for sustained performance.

4. advanced strength and definition (weeks 13-16):

	•	integrate heavy lifting with intense interval workouts to achieve a lean, muscular look.

each phase combines targeted exercises and specific cues to ensure control and optimal form, creating a balance of aesthetics and practical strength similar to the “baki” character’s physique.



weekly schedule

	1.	day 1: compound movements (full-body)
	2.	day 2: explosive conditioning (e.g., hiit, plyometrics)
	3.	day 3: hypertrophy & functional work (upper body focus)
	4.	day 4: rest or active recovery (mobility, stretching)
	5.	day 5: compound movements (lower body emphasis)
	6.	day 6: explosive conditioning (sprints, circuits)
	7.	day 7: hypertrophy & functional work (lower body focus)

each workout emphasizes perfect form, with clear cues to maintain control and prevent injury. this structure allows for balanced growth in strength, power, endurance, and agility, following the baki program’s intense, high-performance goals.","['intermediate', 'novice', 'advanced']","['bodyweight fitness', 'bodybuilding', 'powerbuilding', 'muscle & sculpting', 'athletics']",full gym,16.0,60.0,464,2024-11-03 05:12:00,2025-06-18 10:33:00,112.0

"basic 4-day upper lower (strength training, beginner-novice)","made for my partner, haley, with the goal to have fun liftin some weights at home.

this weekly routine is also a fine option for beginners and novices with access to a barbell and your standard community fitness center equipment (lat pulldown, cable stack, leg extension/curl, dumbbells). i recommend, for complete beginners or anyone coming back after time away from lifting, starting with very light weights and slowly progressing from there week by week. this will give your body time to adapt (or readapt) safely and will reduce your injury risk by the time you've added enough weight to truly push your limits. practice patience, responsibility, and consistency.

the overall volume and exercise selection is quite tolerable and should be fine for most people starting out. be sure to monitor your recovery as the weights get heavier. you might find some areas get sore and stay sore much more than other areas. in this case, subtract 1-2 sets from the delicate muscle group and see how it feels. likewise, if an area hasn't progressed at all for multiple weeks of solid training and recovers well, consider adding 1-2 sets to more resilient/stubborn muscle groups, or using exercises that load that muscle group more in a deeper stretch.","['intermediate', 'advanced', 'novice']","['bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",garage gym,1.0,50.0,14,2024-06-25 04:42:00,2025-06-18 09:35:00,5.833333333333333

giga chad is the program. you're a weighted calisthenics chad. this program is meant to be ran with the context of making dips, pull-ups, and squats as you main variations, or your big 3 in other words. there is still plenty of applicable hypertrophy work as well for people who just enjoy these lifts who want to get extremely jacked. organizationally, this will be pretty similar to primal, but with considerations made for the pull-up and dip

must read:
for dumbbell press, sldl/rdls, row of choice and main bicep curl of choice, the loading is as follows:

week 1: first set 20+ reps to failure, rest of sets to around 10-12 reps 
week 2: first set with 15+ reps to failure, rest of sets rep to about rpe 7
week 3: first set with 12 reps to failure, rest of sets rep to rpe 7
week 4: first set with 10 reps to failure, rest of sets rep to rpe 7
week 5: first set with 8 reps to failure, rest of sets rep to rpe 7 
week 6: first set with 5+ reps to failure, rest of sets remove 15% weight and do sets of 5+ (you can use slightly higher reps on movements where it makes more sense to do so)

become the bear v3.0,"this program is designed for body recomposition: building muscle while shedding fat. it follows a smart push–pull–legs structure over four focused training days per week, with three active recovery days built around daily walking.

the week is split like this:

monday is upper a, focused on pressing strength, shoulder development, and back width. it includes heavy incline pressing, vertical pulling, and a blend of delt and trap work.

wednesday is upper b, targeting arms, forearms, and back thickness. this day uses smart supersets for triceps, biceps, and vertical/horizontal pulling, along with direct neck and forearm work for aesthetics.

thursday is lower body, centered on safe, joint-friendly compound lifts. the priority is glute and hamstring development, with quad, calf, and core work to round things out. all exercises are chosen to be back-safe.

saturday repeats upper a, but you can alternate with upper b every other week or run a lighter version to manage fatigue.

tuesday, friday, and sunday are rest from the gym, but you’ll still do your daily 10,000 steps to stay active, support recovery, and aid fat loss.

what is rpe?
rpe (rating of perceived exersion) is a way to measure the difficulty of a set.

rpe: 
10    could not do more reps or load without form failure
9.5  could not do more reps, could do slightly more load
9     could do 1 more rep
8.5  could definitely do 1 more rep, chance at 2
8     could do 2 more reps
7.5  could definitely do 2 more reps, chance at 3
7     could do 3 more reps
5-6  could do 4-6 more reps
1-4  very light to light effort
source: the muscle & strength pyramid: training book

rules:
• make sure to warm-up before starting your “working” sets

• the last set of each exercise is for as many reps as possible (amrap) with good form.

• if you are able to perform more than 5 reps higher than your previous sets in your amrap, please increase the weight/machine number by 1kg for upper body lifts and 2kg for lower body lifts the next day you train that program day. 

• if your final amrap set is more than 10 reps, consider doubling the weight increase.

• if you fail to get the prescribed reps in the final amrap set, stay at the same weight as last time. if you fail again, then deload by 10%.

• the program can be repeated, with at least 6 weeks minimum recommended.","['novice', 'intermediate', 'advanced']","['bodybuilding', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,6.0,50.0,108,2024-09-09 04:04:00,2025-06-18 10:10:00,35.0

beginner all body compound workout,"i created this workout plan for my girlfriend. she is new to weight training and wanted an introduction into it, with low number of sessions, so it would be easier to get into. the purpose is to gain strength all over the body.

the plan has only 2 sessions per week and the aim is to hit the main muscles all round the body with the minimum amount of exercises. this can be done with compound exercises. they are excellent exercises for any level of experience. 

each session is mixed and instead of just focusing on upper or lower. which i think is better for beginners.

the plan is split into 2 weeks, with exercises changing slightly to make it more interesting and find what works for you. the first split is 3 weeks long because the 1st week you will be finding out what is the right weight to be able to get to failure for the number of reps in the plan. for the final split you will go back to the same exercises to see if you made progress and can lift more weight. 

exercises have 3 sets but feel free to do 4 if you want later on. aim for a rest time between exercises from 2-3 mins

at the beginning, exercises will use dumbbells for some to make in easier to get into. there is one core exercise on day 1 of each week, which isn’t a compound exercise but is very important to do. the core muscles are at the centre of the body and are used in any whole body movement. if you want to do a bit more in your plan, i would recommend doing another for day 2. around the world’s abs exercise is a good recommendation. it will help with your balance immensely.

a tip for beginners before doing any weights:
•watch/read how to do the exercise in the right way and remind yourself every so often. it prevents injury and you work the muscles that are intended.
•perform the full movement of the exercise. if you don’t, you are wasting your time.
•ideally take 1 second for the concentric/positive part of movement and 3 seconds for the eccentric/negative part.
•the workout plan is aimed that you do work each set to failure. that is, if the plan says to do 8 reps you chose a weight that by the 8th you can’t lift another. for beginners i would recommend for the first 2 weeks perform each set with able to one more at the end, to be safe.
•a barbell normally weights 20kg. don’t be intimidated by, it is the just the same as using two 10kg dumbbells but gives you more options.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate']","['bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",garage gym,9.0,40.0,72,2024-08-25 07:51:00,2025-06-18 10:39:00,42.0

beginner calisthenics for big guys,"here's a revised 3-day a week workout plan with exercises that focus on building a strong, durable, and aesthetic body while addressing lower back pain and developing round glutes and shoulders. each exercise includes the muscle groups targeted, instructions for proper form, and sets/reps.

day 1: upper body strength and core stability
focus on building pushing and pulling strength for your chest, shoulders, back, and core.

day 2: lower body (glute-focused) and core
focus on strengthening glutes, hamstrings, quads, and core to improve back stability and build rounder glutes.

day 3: functional full-body strength
emphasize functional movements to improve coordination, posture, and overall strength.

why this plan works for you:

glutes and shoulders: hip thrusts, bulgarian split squats, clamshells, and lateral band walks build round glutes, while pike push-ups, ring push-ups, and wall angels target shoulder aesthetics and strength.

core and back health: bird dogs, hollow holds, and side planks stabilize your spine, preventing back pain.
foundation for advanced moves: builds strength for future progressions like pistol squats.

balanced muscle development: ensures every major muscle group is targeted for a functional and aesthetic physique.

duration and progression:
follow for 8-12 weeks.
track your reps, sets, and form. gradually increase difficulty by:
adding weight to lower-body exercises.
reducing assistance on pull-ups.
increasing time under tension (e.g., holding planks or carries longer).","['intermediate', 'novice']","['muscle & sculpting', 'athletics', 'bodyweight fitness', 'bodybuilding']",at home,12.0,60.0,180,2024-11-17 10:11:00,2025-06-20 01:07:00,84.0

the main exercise (bench press) is varied to not get stale and is used in a linear progression style with dup.
the accesories are volumizing and increasing in effort until deload.

this is a 4 part program. 
this is part 1, an introductory phase where volume and intensity increases for bench press.
accesories increase in volume and effort until the last week you take an all out set which can then be used as a benchmark for the rest of the program.

it is recommended to always start the program with the intro block, then run the volume block atleast once. the volume block can be run multiple times. 
then an intensification block and at last a peaking block to test 1rm on bench press.

you can substitute the bench variations for other ones depending on weaknesses.

berk’s dual chain development,"the purpose of this program is to build a well-balanced, functional physique by training both the anterior (front) and posterior (back) chains equally. using a double progression system, the program promotes consistent strength gains, muscular symmetry, and structural integrity. it’s designed for individuals who want to train smart, prevent imbalances, and improve performance across all major movement patterns.

progression: for compound movements, start with 75%-85% of your max for and begin at the lower end of the given rep range. increase the reps each session. once you reach the top of the range, add 2.5 kg to the bar and start over from the bottom. 

example for bench: start with 100 kg for 6 reps on monday. on thursday, perform 100 kg for 7 reps. the following week, do 100 kg for 8 reps. once you hit the top of the rep range, increase the weight to 102.5 kg and start again at 6 reps — and so on.

berserk method upper lower hypertrophy program,"hypertrophy specific program

this program is 3 times a week with a upper day monday and friday and a lower day on wednesday

use double progressions or linear if it applies

you must be able to recover on this program, do not run it if you can't commit to 9 hours of sleep a night period. 

run this program when you don't care much about strength, this will get you strong in a general sense and you will add pounds to every lift due to the double progression but it won't be as appropriate as a powerlifting program. 

there is really no need for a de-load on this program due to the nature of upper lower giving lots of rest days throughout the week. 

cardio is not listed but it is pretty much mandatory, even if you're bulking, (yes you the one reading this). you must do cardio, high intensity is preferred, but anything low fatigue high stimulus will be peak for this program. 

when you stall out on this program there are a few things you can do. 

1. drop the weight, do higher reps for a few weeks, master the weight and then slowly work your way back up

2. tidy up the form, slow and controlled reps, until you've matched your old rep count. 

3. look at the overall picture, have you been sleeping enough, have you been eating enough, stressed over school or work? 

4. if nothing seems to work, have patience, adding a rep even once a month is going to add 12 reps over the course of a year, muscle growth is a patient mans game and you must overcome this hurdle to push past the trap of being intermediate. 

5. do not program hop or switch exercises, do the exercises, even if you don't like the exercises, even if you don't want to do them, or even if it hurts. being able to manipulate variables on how you perform a lift to make it suit you and your anthropometry is a very valuable asset that will lead to being a smarter and more jacked lifter overall.",['intermediate'],"['powerbuilding', 'powerlifting']",full gym,16.0,60.0,448,2024-12-28 09:21:00,2025-06-18 09:18:00,112.0

this 10-week workout program, originally designed for my girlfriend, is perfect for anyone looking to improve their overall fitness and specifically target glute development. suitable for beginner to novice gym-goers, it only requires 60 minutes per session and utilizes full-gym equipment. the plan spans three days a week, focusing on upper and lower body with a strong emphasis on back and glute muscles.

progression:
each week alternates between adding 2 reps per set and increasing weights by 5-10%, ensuring a balanced progression of strength and endurance over 10 weeks. progress only if your form is on point. this will help you in the long run.

alternative exercises:
swap exercises freely as long as the replacement exercise still hits the muscle of the original one.

blood and guts | dorian yates,"the blood and guts program is a 4 day, high intensity training program built to add serious muscle through low volume, all out effort sessions. inspired by six time mr. olympia dorian yates, this split follows his legendary intensity philosophy. fewer sets, but each taken to absolute failure with brutal precision. each muscle group is trained once per week using heavy compound lifts and targeted isolation work, with every working set pushed to the limit using techniques like rest pause, drop sets, and forced reps. the goal isn’t variety, it’s mastery and consistent progression. by keeping exercises the same and increasing intensity week by week, the program pushes the body to grow while allowing time to recover. this is for lifters who want to train hard, grow big, and keep it simple just like they did in the 90s.

key notes:
rpe 10 = complete failure with no reps left in the tank.
rpe 9.5 = failure is reached with a rest-pause or spotter assist.
most exercises are preceded by 2–3 progressively heavier warm-up sets not taken to failure (rpe 6–8).

the split is modified from dorian’s 3 days on, 1 day off, 1 day on. and is focused on a more easily accessible 4-days a week split, most of the exercises (as mentioned previously) remain the same throughout the training program. this is mainly to assist with progressive overload, and increase the weight weekly on each exercise. getting stronger will assist in getting bigger. progressing each week is key.

important things to consider ->
1.) intensity over volume is everything. this program is built on the principle that one all out set taken to true failure is more effective than multiple submaximal sets. every working set should be pushed as far as possible. if you leave reps in the tank, you’re missing the entire point. warm up thoroughly, but once you’re at your top set, it’s go time. dorian believed in training like it was your last chance to grow, and that mindset is the foundation of the entire approach.
2.) logbook progression is king. (this doesn’t mean you have to write everything down, just remember what you did last week and progress it through weight or reps. key is to stay within the rep range.) you don’t change exercises often. you beat your numbers. this program thrives on progressive overload, hitting more reps with the same weight or adding load over time. every week, you walk in with a plan to beat what you did before. strength and density come from progression, not from variety. if you’re not tracking, you’re guessing, and this split doesn’t reward guesswork.
3.) recovery makes or breaks the results. the brutal nature of training to failure means you can’t afford to slack on sleep, food, or rest days. this split gives you more rest than a typical bodybuilder program because it expects more intensity when you do train. if you eat big, sleep deep, and take recovery seriously, the gains come fast. if you don’t recover fully, you’ll stall or burn out.",['intermediate'],['powerbuilding'],garage gym,4.0,40.0,96,2025-05-21 09:56:00,2025-06-21 10:31:00,18.666666666666668

heavily modified bald omni-man's program bald swordman with peaking phase for weighted dips and pull-ups. 

disregard the prescribed days in the program and train every other day or when you are recovered, just like in the original program (so you should train, 3 or 4 days per week), i recommend 2 days of rest between days 3 and 4.
 
you can add more sets to weighted dips and pull-ups for additional volume. after the last week of the program, deload on all upper body exercises and test your one rep max on dips and pull-ups. rest 90 seconds to 2 minutes on isolation, 3 to 5 minutes on weighted dips and pull-ups, and 2 to 3 minutes on the rest of the compounds.

for the full understanding of the program, read the descriptions above the exercises (the app sometimes doesn't let me put the variation of the exercise which i wanted, fell free to change the exercises for other variations that you like, that are similar enough to the original exercise).if you don't understand the metods like double progression or rep goal system, go check out the original bald omni-man's program.","['beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced']",['bodybuilding'],full gym,12.0,90.0,444,2024-03-12 10:07:00,2025-06-18 10:08:00,126.0

bodybuilding.com 5-day split,"when you're only training 3-4 days a week or full-body or upper/lower splits, you usually can't do 4 or 5 exercises for each muscle group—not unless you have all day to spend in the gym, anyway. but following a five-day split allows you to combine several exercises to blast your target muscle groups from a variety of angles.

it also allows you more space to experiment with more advanced intensity boosters like partials, dropsets, and rest-pause sets.

training guidelines
the sets listed below include only working sets, not warm-up sets. do as many warm-up sets as you need, and never take warm-ups close to muscle failure.
choose 4-5 exercises per larger muscle groups and 2-4 for smaller ones, selecting a load that triggers muscle failure in the 8-12 rep range to maximize hypertrophy.
rest for 60-90 seconds between sets.
because you're training a single muscle group for more sets, consider intra-workout supplements that help combat fatigue. for example, you could take some bcaas during your workout and/or intra-workout carbs to ensure energy levels don't dip.
add either abs or calves wherever makes the most sense to you, up to three times a week.
for the arms workout, alternate the order each week. one week do the biceps first, and the next week do triceps first.

on day 3 for squats, change it to leg press if desired. i left squats in because i don't have a leg press machine in my garage. i recommend doing heavy squat work on day 1, and then more of a technique/volume work on day 3.

bricked up,"the idea: the goal for putting this program together was to make a well rounded four day upper/lower split with just enough volume to keep seeing meaningful results. i have a life outside of the gym and a full time job, i feel like this is a solid split to balance everything between life, work and play. at the end of the day i’m just a regular person living a regular life like i’m sure 99% of you on here are too.

running the program: while running this program try to do the exercises the way they are arranged. these workouts can also be done super setting the exercises. for example on any of the workouts, exercises 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8 can be done as super sets to save you some time. for compound lifts try to stay in a 6-8 rep range. for smaller muscle groups and isolation exercises stay in a 8-12 or a 12-15 rep range. feel free to swap out any exercises but just make sure it’s working the same muscle group. i’d suggest 2-3 rir for first two or three sets then 0-2 rir on the final set for each exercise. don’t hesitate to push your final sets to failure with some partials to even top it off. do use caution on your compounds though, 0-2 rir is definitely sufficient on those movements. use the double progression system and de-load every 6 weeks.

the focus: this program focuses on 8 muscle groups. biceps, triceps, chest, shoulders, back, quads, hamstrings, glutes. if you’re up for training abs and calves with whatever gets you motivated to do them, please do. i could suggest that on your rest days you could do 35-45 min on an incline treadmill for some cardio and even get a little training in for you calves putting them in lengthened position.

bro spilt at home (kickboxing in mind),"this program is multipurpose. i, the creator of the program made this program with the intent to help me maintain and make new gains as i continue to progress on my kickboxing journey. the program is structured in a way to allow you to keep enjoying your weight lifting sessions, while making significant gains, and not to tamper with your mma or other combat sports progressions. with this split, i gave myself 3 days where i can have full kickboxing sessions with sparring once a week. you can fit your kickboxing or boxing sessions on monday, with chest, and saturday, with back, and sunday, where it is the kickboxing standalone, sunday can be used as your sparring day. (kickboxing and boxing mainly uses your legs, shoulders and abs, that’s why working chest and back on your kickboxing days isn’t too troublesome). if you so desire, you can even add a fourth kickboxing day, on your rest day on friday. 

the split is as follows:
monday-chest 
tuesday- legs
wednesday - shoulders
thursday -arms
friday - rest
saturday - back
sunday- rest / kickboxing.

rpe - how far are you from failure?

4 = you could do 6 more reps
5 = you could do 5 more reps
6 = you could do 4 more reps
7 = you could do 3 more reps
8 = you could do 2 more reps
9 = you could do 1 more rep
10 = you couldn't do another rep

just do your best here; you'll get better at estimating over time. 

progression:

shoot to add weight & reps over time, while staying within the rpe range.  

it's okay if you can't get the same weight across all sets when there are multiple sets.  stay within the rpe range, inch forward however you can - more reps, weight, or both - and you're on the right track.

diet:

protein shake = 2-3 x day
milk = at least 1 serving, which should be 240 grams if you just weigh it.
protein = 1 scoop; i recommend ryse & ghost for good brands. serving should be around 150 - 200 calories, and about 25 grams of protein. 

rice = 1-2 x day
really any rice you want.  the cooked weight should be somewhere between 200 - 300 grams, based on what you can prep & works for you.  err on the higher side if you can only get this in once a day.

snack = 1 x day
banana + peanut butter (any nut butter will do)
this is sort of an icing on the cake to make sure you get calories in; just about everyone can pack extra calories with peanut butter. 

body notes:
weigh yourself daily & track every weigh in.  

keep in mind we're just looking for an average here at the end of each week.  it's super normal for your weight to fluctuate day to day. 

we want the scale trending upward at around .5lbs a week.  if you start to feel super crappy/slow and like you're just getting fat though, we can pull the diet mods out as needed.

you don't have to take progress pictures, but they can be a huge help, even if they're just for you.  change happens so slowly sometimes that we don't even notice it.",['intermediate'],"['athletics', 'muscle & sculpting']",full gym,9.0,60.0,217,2025-03-01 08:51:00,2025-06-18 11:57:00,63.0

""this is an a/b structure that might look familiar. it's an old-school favorite for new lifters because it simplifies your split into 2 easy-to track workouts. it also limits slots for exercises, which you might think is a bad thing... but for green lifters it's a great thing. as the saying goes, ""when water is limited, only the important things get washed"", and in this case it means there is only room for key barbell movements (and maybe a few minutes at the end for some direct arm work).""

some important notes:

* ""4x6+ is one of my staple progressions: it means '4 sets with the same weight, but the 4th set is done as an amrap (as many reps as possible)""
* ""3xf means '3 sets to failure, or as many as you can without getting sloppy'... your goal is to fail in the 8-12 rep range on each set, if you go above 12, add a bit of weight, if you go below 8, drop some.""

""for true beginners, who are likely lifting by themselves and haven't quite developed an irrational love of the gym yet, it is a very smart strategy to limit your work to the big 5. doing so will keep you from jumping around to a bunch of different things or, worse yet, scheduling too much work that you bail on when you get tired or bored. we need to build good habits at the start, and that means aiming for 100% completion, even if it means scheduling less work.

focusing on fewer lifts also will provide a ton of skill-specific practice for those lifts, no different than a gymnast or figure skater working on their flips and spins. you won't really see gains until you get over the hump of awkwardness that prevents you from putting out max effort (hard to pr on a squat or deadlift when every rep has you feeling like a knock-kneed baby giraffe). this is where the 4x6+ progression shines; the 3 sets of light 6s to 'grease the groove', as they say, will build confidence, refine technique, and more importantly, make everything automatic. many athletes talk about ""the zone"", where focus is crisp and effortless and every shot is nothing but net. in lifting, that's the point where you can shut your brain of and let pure aggression fuel the set.

why this program?
	•	strength first, aesthetics second – you won’t find random banded exercises or fluff workouts here. this program prioritizes heavy, compound lifts with focused accessory work to enhance glute and hamstring development.
	•	balanced lower-body training – if your quads take over every movement, this program will help shift the load, reinforcing proper mechanics and muscle engagement.
	•	no-nonsense programming – every exercise serves a purpose, with structured progression to ensure you’re getting stronger and more powerful over time.

who is this for?
	•	women who squat heavy but feel the load primarily in their quads.
	•	lifters who want to build stronger glutes and hamstrings without sacrificing overall strength.
	•	those looking for a smart, progressive, and effective program that delivers results.

what’s included:
✅ a progressive powerbuilding plan designed for strength & hypertrophy.
✅ five strength-focused workouts per week.
✅ squat, bench, and deadlift progressions combined with targeted glute & hamstring movements.
✅ five weeks of mesocycle with an optional deload week 
✅ no gimmicks—just real, effective training that delivers results.

chase karnes' kentucky strong: 5/3/1 for strongman,"you will be using the 5/3/1 protocol on the overhead press, incline bench press, deadlift, front squat, log clean & press, yoke walk, and farmers walk for the program above.
as you can see, each cycle lasts four weeks, and i have two cycles laid out for a total of eight weeks.

week 1: 3x5
week 2: 3x3
week 3: 3x5, 3, 1
week 4: deload

and for the moving events it’ll be:

week 1: 3x distance
week 2: 3x distance
week 3: 3x distance
week 4: deload

to determine the weights used for all of the lifts above (excluding the moving events), you’ll take your 1rm and figure 90% of this number. all of your calculations are now based off of this number.

week 1: 3x5 @ 65%, 75%, 85%
week 2: 3x3 @ 70%, 80%, 90%
week 3: 1x5 @ 75%, 1x3 @ 85%, 1x1 @95%
week 4: deload 3x5 @ 60%

so if your 1rm on the log press is 330 pounds, you use 300 pounds (90%)

here is how it works for the log press in this example:

week 1: 195x5, 225x5, 255x5+
week 2: 210x3, 240x3, 270x3+
week 3: 225x5, 255x3, 285x1+
week 4: 3x5 @ 180

increase training max by five pounds and recalculate.

week 5: 200x5, 230x5, 260x5+
week 6: 215x3, 245x3, 275x3+
week 7: 230x5, 260x3, 290x1+
week 8: 3x5 @ 185

increase training max by five pounds and recalculate.

when you see the 5+, 3+, or 1+ that simply means that you’ll perform as many reps as possible with that weight (preferably leaving one to two reps in the tank). you’ll focus on setting rep prs and then beating those rep prs in upcoming weeks.

you’ll increase your training max by five pounds on overhead press, incline bench press, and log press. you’ll also increase your training max by 10 pounds on the deadlift and front squat.

on to the moving events
most of you are probably wondering what i mean by “3x distance.” this is what you do: let’s say your best yoke run with no drops is 750 pounds for 80 feet.

take 90% of 750 pounds.
this would be 675 pounds.
figure 65%, 75%, 85%.
that would be 440 pounds, 505 pounds, and 575 pounds.
now figure 70%, 80%, 90% of that original 675 pounds.
that would be 475 pounds, 540 pounds, and 610 pounds.
now figure 75%, 85%, 95% of that original 675 pounds.
that would be 505 pounds, 575 pounds, and 640 pounds.
we now have our weights.

week 1: 440x80 ft., 505x80ft., 575x80 ft.
week 2: 475x80ft., 540x80ft., 610x80ft.
week 3: 505x80ft., 575x80ft., 640x80ft.
week 4: *omit for the yoke walk.
*for farmers walk, you’ll run around 60% and focus on speed.

you’ll increase your training max for the yoke walk by 10 to 15 pounds and your farmers walk by 10 pounds at the end of each cycle.
these can also be done for frame carries. these would be done for the heaviest weight you’ve done for a certain distance with no drops. for the yoke walk, farmers walk, and frame carry, i’d recommend sticking with a distance no shorter than 50 feet and no longer than 100 feet. if you want to perform a turn on the farmers, that’s fine. just make sure you figure your percentages based on your best farmers walk with a turn and no drops.","['intermediate', 'advanced']",['bodybuilding'],garage gym,8.0,90.0,110,2024-11-07 06:49:00,2025-06-18 09:21:00,84.0

chosen undead: a supertotal program,"this is a supertotal program based on the specifications of glenn pendlay olympic weightlifting and powerlifting coach.

the only things given are the main lift's order and the goals of each day. basically this is my interpretations of the program including progression and accesories

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

here is the basic layout of the days:

day 1: squat & bench session / medium /

day 2: snatch & clean and jerk session / light /

day 3: front squat & push press session / heavy /

day 4: snatch & clean and jerk & deadlift session / heavy /

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

between the days it is recommended to take a rest day and only work out every second day for optimal recovery.

the first workout is a somewhat heavy powerlifting day where we want the golden middle path between intensity a technique practice. for this day i chose a linear periodization, a classic 5x5. we start with 70% and every week bump up the number by 1-2% ideally. you could go for more but that would mean we reset more frequently. your choice really.

the second day is a light oly day relly focusing on technique and volume. i would recommend complexes based on the weakness of your lifts. for snatches i really like snatch into overhead squats and for clean and jerks (from now on cnj) clean into front squat into press.

third day is a heavy day where we front squat and push press. you could swap the push press to overhead press it's personal preference. this day will help with both of our goals where we develop leg and pressinf strenght, while we improve our front rack position and overhead strenght. this day we do the topset backoff set method. we do a topset where we do a soft max of 1-3 reps. we basically do around 92-100% of our true max based on how we feel that day. when we backoff we take back 10-15% and do a couple set of threes.

day 4 is the heavy oly day. we basically go up on the instensity and do around 6-10 singles of 90%+ on both of our lifts

conjugate base,this program is for people who want to give a bad conjugate program a go. it is bench and deadlift focused. change exercises to fit your needs.,['intermediate'],"['bodybuilding', 'powerlifting', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,9.0,60.0,197,2024-03-19 01:34:00,2025-06-18 11:39:00,63.0
conjugate made easy,"conjugate is one of the best training methods in existence if you understand and follow the core principles. it checks all the boxes. you get to lift heavy weight regularly and push your limits. you get sufficient volume frequently enough to consistently build muscle. you'll often be moving weight with speed and force. it offers ample opportunity to improve technique on the main compound lifts. there's a ton of exercise variety. 

conjugate will get you both strong and jacked.

conjugate based programs are typically not of the cookie cutter variety because to truly get the most out of it you must both understand the fundamentals deeply, and be attentive and understanding of how you personally react to different stimuli - this takes time and experience. however, learning needs to start somewhere and a cookie cutter program is very likely a better place to start than trying to design your own program.

this program is fueled by having run and experimented voraciously with conjugate programming for multiple years. it can pretty much be run on repeat forever.

notes:
you’ll lift 4 days per week. the workouts are best organized during the week as:
- max lower
- max upper
- rest
- dynamic lower
- dynamic upper
- rest
- rest

max days consist of a max attempt on a squat, deadlift, or bench. they’re programmed as 1 rep max attempts, but you could also do a 3 or 5 reps max (i personally wouldn't go any higher than 3 reps).  a max attempt means doing the most you can on the day, and this may very well be less than your pr. a good rule of thumb is to change max exercises after doing them 3 times. however, if you're still getting stronger on a particular variant you’re free to continue using it. you can also change variants every week ad infinitum, but a few should be done often enough to gauge progress. 

dynamic work consists of a squat and dead on lower days and a bench on upper days. 

on lower days you’ll do 8 sets of 2 on squat and 6 sets of 1 on deadlift.
on upper days you'll do 9 sets of 3 on bench. 

all sets are done with 1 minute of rest between. all 3 exercises will progress via increases in 1rm percent over the course of 3 weeks as follows:
week 1: 60% of 1rm
week 2: 65%
week 3: 70%

all reps on dynamic lifts must move with speed. if there’s bar slowdown reduce the weight. a major benefit of dynamic work is the opportunity it offers for technical refinement because of the high number of reps you’ll be performing. with this in mind, i’d stick with the big 3 lifts as much as possible on the dynamic days.

every workout will include accessory and/or supplemental work after the max or dynamic work. they’re programmed as:
- 3x3 for supplemental exercises (squat, dead, and bench variants)
- 4x8 for leg and back accessories
- 3x12 for shoulders, arms, glutes, and ab accessories

this is done for the sake of simplicity, but you can change to appropriate ranges for the exercise being performed.",['beginner'],['athletics'],garage gym,6.0,60.0,138,2025-05-25 10:46:00,2025-06-25 04:43:00,42.0

conjugate phul,"built to combine principles of the wsbb conjugate program and a traditional phul, combines some key concepts from each. focus is placing more emphasis on the conjugate method for performance, but still includes some nuance from phul for hypertrophy and growth. 

max effort (me) goal of 3-5 reps on top set for heavy days, rest as much as needed between sets. dynamic effort (de) days will include some hypertrophy principles, but de movements will target 6-8 sets of 2/3 reps (2 for lower, 3 for upper), with short (1 minute) rest between sets. 

me lifts should rotate every 3 weeks to avoid stagnating, with goal to progressively overload each movement over time - top set should either add reps or add weight each week, no matter how minimal. me top sets followed by 2-3 sets of 80%, same rep range (use these to help auto-regulate and determine progressions, as well as pick up extra volume when necessary). accessories should be targeted to any notable weak points. 

de days take on more of the hypertrophy burden, and should be regularly reviewed to determine what accessories are needed. some general hypertrophy will always be included, but add or adjust as fatigue, imbalances, and time allow.

alternate primary left every 4th week (i.e. keeping each movement x3 weeks at a time). make sure variations are complementary (i.e. if dl on me day, squat on de day, and vice versa - same with ohp and bench. make sure to regularly alternate which is me and which is de).",['intermediate'],"['bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",garage gym,12.0,90.0,336,2025-06-13 02:49:00,2025-06-18 08:47:00,126.0

david goggins stretching routine,"stretch like david goggins.

while david goggins often stretches for multiple hours per day, most  mortals can certainly get by with much less.  the 3 minutes that's noted for each stretch is just an arbitrary number and holds no special meaning. 

push each stretch to about an 7 or 8 on a 1-10 scale and then hold it there until it feels pretty uncomfortable.  feel free to repeat a specific stretch as many times as desired, with short rests between.  on the other hand, for some stretches you may need only 30 seconds to maintain flexibility.

dorian yates inspired 4x/week torso-limbs program,"this program is inspired by a high-intensity torso & limb split that draws inspiration from dorian yates’ legendary 1983-85 methods. it is designed to maximize hypertrophy and strength while challenging you to push beyond your comfort zone.

key application features include:
	•	structured training split: four sessions per week alternating between upper body (torso) and lower body plus arms (limb) workouts, incorporating both compound movements and isolation exercises.
	•	intensity techniques:
	•	controlled negatives: slow and deliberate eccentric phases to extend time under tension and intensify muscle stress.
	•	forced reps & drop sets: employed to push muscles past initial fatigue for enhanced growth stimulation.
	•	rest-pause and isometric holds: additional methods to boost intensity and maintain continuous muscle engagement.
	•	rpe guidelines:
	•	most sets are executed at an rpe of 7–8, ensuring you have about 2–3 reps in reserve.
	•	for heavy compound lifts, an rpe of 8–9 is targeted to maximize strength gains while preserving proper form.
	•	progressive overload & recovery: gradual increases in load, repetitions, or intensity techniques promote consistent progress, while structured rest intervals (typically 2–3 minutes) and dedicated warm-up/cool-down routines help manage fatigue and reduce injury risk.

overall, this program’s high-intensity design—combined with a variety of advanced methods—ensures comprehensive muscle stimulation and sustainable progress for those ready to commit to a challenging yet effective training regimen. you can push this program for 2-3 months and advance to a ppl program with more volume.","['beginner', 'novice']","['athletics', 'bodybuilding', 'bodyweight fitness']",full gym,1.0,60.0,24,2025-03-03 06:02:00,2025-06-28 04:34:00,7.0

engorged,"5-day upper/lower full-body assault for maximal mass and power

engorged is not just a program—it’s a declaration of war on mediocrity. designed for serious lifters who demand visible results and relentless intensity, this 5-day hybrid split combines strategic upper/lower training with full-body synergy to forge unmatched size, strength, and muscular endurance.

each week is a tactical campaign:
	•	day 1: upper power – press, pull, and row with primal aggression. compound movements lead the charge to ignite the nervous system and set the tone.
	•	day 2: lower power – build a foundation like granite. squats, hinges, and explosive lifts carve out legs that don’t just support mass—they command it.
	•	day 3: full-body density – high volume meets total-body overload. giant sets, supersets, and calculated chaos flood every fiber with nutrient-rich blood. the pump? monumental.
	•	day 4: upper hypertrophy – refine the armor. target shoulders, arms, and chest with surgical precision. isolation meets intensity in a cascade of controlled destruction.
	•	day 5: lower hypertrophy & conditioning – sprint, lift, and finish the fight. this isn’t leg day—it’s leg war. expect volume, sweat, and a metabolic storm.

engorged isn’t for beginners. it’s for lifters who eat intensity for breakfast and grind out reps with a grow-or-die mindset. backed by science and fueled by fury, this program delivers the physique of a battle-hardened titan.

tips/ explanations: 

-each workout is designed going from lower body (1 exercise for glutes, quads, hamstrings) to upper body and then upper limbs.

- start each excercise with 1-2 warm up sets in which you use the same rep range and form but with a lot lighter weight than the 3 working sets. 


- 3x8-10 means you do 3 sets within the rep range of 8-10. if you can't do the minimum rep requirement on each set the weight is too heavy. once you pass the top end of the rep range for each set you must go up in weight. especially in the lower body heavy sets. you must keep them heavy. so for example hipthrust 3x6-8, if you get 10,9,9 go up.","['intermediate', 'advanced']","['athletics', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,6.0,70.0,108,2024-06-14 01:13:00,2025-06-27 12:13:00,49.0

easy balance,"technique:

make sure to always keep the weight controlled in the eccentric (when you're letting the weight down). it doesn't need to be super slow, but it should be completely under your control. controlled eccentrics contribute to muscle growth. always listen to your body, each person's joints and mobility are different. what is ideal squat technique for 1 body may be bad technique for another body. there's no need to be slow on the concentric (when your muscle is contracting). watch a variety of videos online where people demonstrate the movements. in general, it is best to get as much range of motion as is possible without pain. of course if your joints hurt in a certain position, don't go to that position. however, if you feel comfortable when doing it, a longer range of motion is typically better because it'll mean you can get the same muscle growth out of less weight. for isolation work especially, it is important to focus on the feeling of the muscles to figure out exactly what technique gives you the best muscle growth stimulus and the least irritation.

intensity:

take compound lifts to within ~1-5 reps of failure. be strict about form; if there is any form breakdown (meaning your form changes noticable from the first rep of the set to the last rep of the set), stop the set. for isolation movements, you can push closer to failure as long as you're free of any joint pain or tightness. it is expected and desired to have the reps slow down as you go - slower reps means you are closer to failure, which is important from a bodybuilding perspective. in short, we want to push the muscles themselves near failure, while still keeping our form clean and consistent. 

progression:

use ""double progression"", a fancy way of saying: go for a range of reps on a lift (say 8-12). if you can get all 12 and you feel able to, increase the weight slightly for next time. you'll probably get slightly fewer reps, and then work back up to 12 over time. then the process repeats. being patient here is good - no need to add 20 lbs at once if you can just add 5 lbs. and for some isolation movements like lateral raises, which are hard to progress in, you can just keep adding more and more reps for a while until you're able to do a higher weight. note: its fine and normal to have your strength fluctuate, or even go down, what matters is the long term trend. don't worry if you're not able to get the same weight and reps you did last week, just do the best you can

exercise selection:

if any exercise feels bad, unpleasant on joints, back, etc - just don't do it! there are always safe and comfortable alternatives out there. try out new exercises with as low weight as possible - even with no weight at all. if they feel bad with very little resistance, don't bother adding them to your program.

warming up:

always gradually warm up. start by doing the movement with no weight, then light weight, then increase gradually until your working sets.",['beginner'],"['athletics', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,2.0,60.0,36,2025-04-25 05:59:00,2025-06-18 09:21:00,14.0

farmer mode,"you need more work capacity. this is the bottom line. no, your 3/4 day powerlifting/bodybuilding/calisthenics split is not going to get you there. 

yes, you need to do dedicated conditioning work. no, it doesn’t have to involve wasting away on the treadmill. 

farmer mode is designed to supplement your strength and hypertrophy training with movements that actually make you more capable, athletic, and useful. skip the treadmill and carry weights for distance, drag sleds for time, and become what evolution intended for you. be warned that progressing with the barbell and this program at the same time will be difficult if you are in a caloric deficit or otherwise not on top of recovery, but in the long run, increasing your work capacity will pay off not only in the gym but for your health in general. 

the program introduces full body functional movements slowly, as people are often not used to this level of conditioning and time under tension (5 minute+ carries, for example). volume is cycled down in week four to make room for additional exercises and to shed accumulated stress. the rpe on all exercises is kept low as to minimize interference with regular weight training. 

as a rule of thumb, if the rpe starts creeping up and you don’t have a deload the next week in your ordinary program, stop and take a breather before continuing the set. 

the exercise selection focuses on the foundations of human movement - walking, carrying, throwing. things that we are supposed to be doing but aren’t in today’s world. light weights are used to make it harder to stay upright, increase cardiovascular burden, and strengthen movement patterns that are often ignored in normal training. 

rucking and sled work make up the main drivers of cardiovascular and muscular conditioning improvement. weighted carries assist in reinforcing posture and target grip strength, a major indicator for overall health. throws and lunges round out the program by introducing more full body and unilateral movement. in concert, these exercises with improve physical resiliency in several dimensions without sacrificing too much room for strength gains.

all that, and let’s be real for second, women are tougher than men.

reason number two, and as a result of reason number one, the increased training frequency leads to better muscle tone, strength, and leaner physiques.

so, if that sounds like something you’re personally interested in keep reading.

outlined below is the best full body workout program for most (healthy) women.

outlined below are 4 full body workouts perfect for women looking to build lean muscle, lose fat, and increase strength.

as written, the program can be performed in an every other day fashion where you rotate the workouts each day you go to the gym.

alternatively, you can perform the workouts on monday, tuesday, thursday, and friday (or in a 2 days on/1 day off fashion).

each workout is broken up into a primary workout. these are the exercises that are necessary to perform on that training day. for your rest periods, you’ll want to rest anywhere between 45-90 seconds. for larger lifts, such as squats, you may want to take the full 90 seconds.

after the primary workout on each day is an additional optional workout you can perform immediately after your primary full body workout. these additional workouts isolate the glutes, core, and arms. for your rest periods with these exercises, limit them to 30 seconds.

the reason for the two glute isolation workouts is due to the common goal among women to grow their glutes. this is best achieved through training the glutes at least 4 times per week, with two of the glute workouts being isolated-focus with higher repetitions.

any of these additional bonus workouts can be altered in any way that best fits your own individual goals.",['advanced'],['bodybuilding'],full gym,12.0,70.0,300,2024-09-02 12:19:00,2025-06-18 11:44:00,98.0

full body ( adjustable ) dumbbells hypertrophy,"this is a 3-day per week hypertrophy program for all levels of lifter. each workout targets the whole body. the program is set up in a way that slightly favors your arms and shoulders, though the back, chest, and legs also are worked plenty in each session. this program is best for people with access to a set of adjustable dumbbells or hotel gyms, which often have limited equipment.

the program should be run 3 days per week with at least one day of rest in between. if you want to increase volume, just perform the next workout every other day, which will result in a 3.5 day per week average. this program can be run indefinitely, but make sure to deload once in a while if you feel worn out or are stuck in your progression.

it's recommended to perform myo-rep sets on all the isolation exercises (incline curls, overhead extensions, skull crushers, lateral raises, reverse flyes). this will add stimulus and promote more growth in your arms and shoulders. you can google what myo-rep sets are, but in short, it means this:

perform your first set like normal, striving to come close to failure. then, on the rest of the sets, after failure, you will rest for just a couple of seconds and then resume the set until you reach the number you reached on your first set. this results in coming to or close to failure more than just three times, and will really contribute to growth. here's an example:

incline curls:
set 1: 11 reps
set 2: 9 reps, rest a few seconds, then 2 more reps
set 3: 8 reps, rest a few seconds, 2 more reps, rest a few seconds, 1 more rep

in this example, your biceps would reach muscular failure around six times instead of just three. good stuff!

don't do myo-reps on the more strenuous compound movements like chinups, squats, rdls or the bench pressing movements as this will be extremely fatiguing and could potentially lead to injury.

saker att komma ihåg och lite coach notes. det är viktigt att du varje vecka försöker bli starkare så vi kommer använda något som heter double progression. det innebär att varje vecka ska du antingen öka i vikt eller reps. ungefär såhär:

vecka 1. så tar du 12 reps på x kg. nästa vecka ska du öka i vikt så att du tar 6-8 stycken reps, sen kör du den vikten tills du kan göra 12 reps. sen repeat.

exempel.

sets: 

1, 10 reps
2, 9 reps
3, 8 reps

nästa vecka sikta på:

1, 11 reps
2, 8-9
3, 8

get big,"bodybuilding program with some emphasis on weighted calisthenics. the program has a heavier arm focus than the torso, so it is well suited to anyone with a torso dominant physique they’re looking to correct. follows an upper/lower split with 4x a week frequency. uses antagonist supersets to save time and increase work capacity. each movement pattern will be trained using a main lift and a secondary lift, followed by various isolation lifts. for example, the horizontal press uses the bench press as the main lift and the larsen press for the secondary. progression will depend on the priority of the lift. 

for main lifts, use dynamic double progression, where weight jumps are done each set on an exercise depending on the performance on that set in the prior training session. an example using the bench press with a target rep range of 4-8 reps:
- week 1 performance 
   - set 1: 100kg x 8
   - set 2: 100kg x 6
   - set 3: 100kg x 6
- week 2 weight based on week 1 performance 
   - set 1: 102.5kg
   - set 2: 100kg
   - set 3: 100kg
in the above example, you would increase the weight on sets 2 and 3 in the session following the one where you achieve the full 8 reps on each respective set.

for secondary lifts, use standard double progression, where you achieve the top end of the target rep range on each set before a weight jump.

for tertiary and isolation lifts, use evolving rep ranges, where instead of having to get the top end of the rep range for each set, you only need to on the first set, then get ‘close enough’ on the subsequent sets before progressing weight. an example using the barbell curl with a target rep range of 6-10 reps:

this performance justifies a weight jump in the following session, as you achieved the top end of the rep range on the first set, with each following set being close. this allows for faster progression than standard double progression but maintains its simplicity, which will be useful for breaking plateaus on these smaller lifts which can be stubborn in terms of weight progression.

for t1: 15+ reps = add 10 lbs
              10-14 reps = add 5 lbs

for t2: 30+ reps = add 10 lbs

gaspesian powerhouse (gzcl),"💪 training overview (its monday/wednesday/friday) (a/b/c + d/a/b + c/d/a etc)

this program follows a balanced, four-day structure focused on strength, hypertrophy, and movement variation. each day is built around a tier 1 (t1) primary lift for maximal strength development, a tier 2 (t2) variation or secondary compound lift for volume and technical reinforcement, and a series of accessories targeting hypertrophy and joint health.

t1 — main strength movement (heavy, lower rep, progression-based)

t2 — variation / secondary movement (moderate volume, technique focus)

accessories — targeted muscle growth, weak point addressing, and joint balance.

this setup is designed to:

prioritize progressive overload on the big lifts.

improve muscle symmetry and structural integrity.

allow enough recovery between similar movement patterns.

support both performance and aesthetics.

intended to be done in order written. adjustments should only be made when equipment is unavailable. if always unavailable, please refer to bodyweight exclusive program that i will also provide. ensure good balance of bilateral and unilateral movements if making substitutions. recommended substitutions will be included in exercise notes.



sprint work notes:

to improve your top speed, you have to train at or extremely close to your top speed. conditioning your muscles to movement at your top speed is very specific and should be done with a lot of intention.

this means you should:
• stop sprinting when you start slowing down. sprints will be limited to 3-6 intervals. this is intentional, sprint training should be *relatively* easy. picture it like practice touches
• only do sprint training when feeling 100%
• never train with weighted sprints (maybe for conditioning, but never for speed)



plyometric work notes:

because it has an emphasis on speed and explosiveness, you want to be as fresh as possible while performing plyometrics. training these while fatigued will only serve to condition your body to move through these patterns slowly. you’ll want to do plyometrics after your dynamic warmup, but before any of your majorly taxing movements for the day (ie sprints, weighted movements, soccer sessions, cardio, etc.)

plyometrics should be done with the utmost scrutiny and intentionality. proper form for jumping and landing may seem intuitive, but almost always begins to degrade after multiple reps, where many begin to see themselves falling into comfortable movement patterns that may not be efficient for explosiveness and power output.

make sure you’re not only trying to be explosive, but also landing properly, and, when necessary, making ground contact as short and efficient as possible.



gym work notes:

strength progression encouraged on main compound lift (+5-10lb added to top set weight week-by-week, maintain same amount of reps), if unable, maintain weight at current rep count, trying for an extra rep in your top set.

you may add isolation volume for muscles like shoulders, biceps, and triceps if desired. add at end of upper body workouts though, if at all.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate', 'advanced']","['athletics', 'muscle & sculpting', 'bodyweight fitness']",full gym,4.0,70.0,96,2024-11-14 10:32:00,2025-06-18 11:44:00,32.666666666666664

helium: 6-day full body hlm,"helium is a full body hlm (heavy/light/medium) program that’s designed to be run anywhere from 3-6 days per week. having a busy and erratic schedule requires programming with great flexibility and that is the driving force behind this program.

structure:
as mentioned, helium allows you to lift anywhere from 3 to 6 days per week.  it’s written as follows:

week 1
1. heavy
2. light
3. medium
4. heavy
5. light
6. medium
7. heavy

week 2
1. medium
2. light
3. heavy
4. medium
5. light
6. heavy
7. medium

repeat

it’s set up this way because every 3 day stretch must include either a light workout or a rest day, and this layout assures that’s possible.  your read that right - light days are not required. if you prefer to do heavy-medium-rest-heavy-medium-rest you can certainly do that. you can also run is as heavy-light-medium-heavy-light-medium.  you can even do heavy-rest-medium-rest-heavy-rest-medium.  the structure as it’s written allows all of these approaches and more, and also allows them to change from one week to the next based upon your schedule and availability.

each day will consist of 4-5 lifts and include both upper body and lower body work. helium utilizes supersets and giant sets for the vast majority of exercises, but these are incorporated only for time saving purposes and all exercises can be done separately if you so choose.

progression:
double progression should be used for all lifts. when you’ve reached the top end of the rep range for an exercise (either on the first set, or on all sets - whichever you prefer) you’ll increase weight on that exercise next time you do it.  for example, if you’re doing a bench press with 165 pounds and the rep range is 6-8, if you’re able to do 8 reps you’ll increase the weight to 170 pounds the next time you bench press.

notes:
- if you don’t like, or can’t perform, a specific exercise, feel free to use an appropriate replacement.  i’ll repeat - appropriate replacement.  don’t change a squat to a curl because it’s an entirely different body part, lol. also be cognizant of whether you’re doing a heavy, light, or medium day.  a logical exercise on a heavy day would be a low bar squat. you could change this to a high bar squat or a safety bar squat, but shouldn’t change it to a goblet squat or a lunge (these would be more appropriate for a light day).
- don’t mistake heavy, light, and medium for effort levels. heavy, light, and medium could be more accurately described as referring to the relative amount of stress the workout will incur. effort level should be high every day. 
- helium can be repeated for as long as you’re progressing on it.",['novice'],['bodybuilding'],garage gym,6.0,50.0,99,2024-01-09 02:38:00,2025-06-18 08:43:00,35.0
heavy duty,"mike mentzer training method summary:

mike mentzer's heavy duty approach emphasizes high-intensity, low-volume training to maximize muscle growth while minimizing overtraining. key principles include:

high intensity: lift near-maximal weights with perfect form, pushing each set to muscular failure (unable to perform another rep).

low volume: typically 1 set per exercise, prioritizing quality over quantity to avoid excessive strain.

infrequent workouts: train each muscle group once every 7–10 days to allow full recovery, critical for growth.

compound exercises: focus on multi-joint movements (e.g., squats, deadlifts, presses) for efficiency and systemic stress.

progressive overload: gradually increase weight or resistance to continually challenge muscles.

individualization: adjust frequency/volume based on personal recovery capacity and progress.

rest emphasis: prioritizes sleep, nutrition, and stress management to support recovery.

mentzer opposed traditional high-volume routines, arguing brief, intense sessions followed by ample rest optimize hypertrophy. his philosophy blends arthur jones' principles with a scientific approach to avoid overtraining.","['novice', 'intermediate']","['bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",full gym,18.0,40.0,288,2025-04-19 04:59:00,2025-06-18 10:46:00,84.0
heavy duty training,"this is a low volume approach. 1 set to muscular failure, meaning gun to your head another rep is not possible. heavy duty training requires an adequate rest period between workouts, a minimum of 72 hours but preferably every 96 hours. every rep will include a 4 second concentric and 4 second eccentric(this does not provide any hypertrophic benefits, it just makes the exercise safer). lastly, if you are a beginner, focus your first month or two on nailing down your form. and remember you'll only get better at exerting yourself as time goes on. training to failure will be easier as you train more and more thus giving you better workouts every time.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate', 'advanced']",['muscle & sculpting'],full gym,1.0,30.0,11,2024-03-05 09:13:00,2025-06-18 11:44:00,3.5
heavy duty training by mike mentzer,"this program is designed to help you reach your own muscular size and strength potential as fast as possible.

for this programm i have used the book "" heavy duty training "" by mike mentzer and john little, while also implementing suggestions from mr america hearts youtube channel.

important to know is that you should perform each rep controlled and slow but not so slow so as you fall asleep.

this means that you raise the weight for 4 seconds, hold the contraction for 2 seconds, and lower the weight for 4 seconds. although you may perform the raise of the weight for the lateral raise with a little swing at the bottom and for the hammer curl you don't have to hold the contracted position, since there is no resistance at the highest position.


if you want to perform the programm to its fullest i'd still suggest you read the book by mike mentzer and john little.
i'm not advertising here, just suggesting something based on my own knowledge.

i'd suggest you warmup up before each workout. this means warming up the joints which are stressed. for upper days this means the shoulders and wrists. and for lower days the knees and hip joints. you should also do some form of cardio for 5-10 min to limber up.

warmup sets per exercise should be performed as such:
for each superset you warmup on the second exercise, so for the chest you would warm up on the incline press.

now using the deadlift as an example, if you are able to 70 kg for 7 reps, you would begin with 50 kg for 7 to reps 10 to get the blood flowing into the area, and then one more set with 60 kg for 2 or 3 reps to mentally prepare for the heavier set to follow.


after a workout you should also perform a cool down stretch so that you won't damage your body and help recovery. (hold each stretch for 30 to 40 seconds.


lastly you should also perform cardio two times a week for 30 minutes. this can be on or off your workout days. preferably before a workout if you do it on your workout days.

and of course of the utmost importance each working set must be performed to a point of complete momentary muscular failure within the recommended rep range.

if you are able to complete 10 or for the legs 20 reps of the suggested exercise, with your chosen weight, you will add 2.5 kg -5kg the next session, so that you will stay in the suggested rep range. in short you will perform progressive overload. and i guarantee that you will hit pr's every session if you follow the workout program accordingly.

rest periods between workouts should be at least 48 to 92 hours. so for example if you start with chest and back on monday you'd train legs the earliest on wednesday and the latest on friday. this depends solely on your ability to recover since this varies for each individual.




on a side note i modified the program to fit my specific weaknesses. i added the dumbell row and hammer curl, if you don't have problems in those areas you can leave them out.",['intermediate'],"['powerlifting', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,12.0,60.0,114,2024-06-05 09:03:00,2025-06-18 12:13:00,84.0

highland strong,"program overview:
this program is designed for highland games athletes who are looking to improve their overall strength and throwing performance. it combines weigh training and event-specific training over a 7-week period, culminating in a competition.

structure:
the program consists of two gym days per week and one field day. gym day a focuses on lower body exercises with some upper body accessories, while gym day b emphasizes upper body work with lower body accessories. both gym days conclude with back exercises. the field day alternates between two event cycles, with slight variations in the order and inclusion of certain events.

progression:
the program follows a 7-week structure that includes an introduction week, accumulation phases, intensification phases, a peak week, and a competition week. unlike traditional programs that decrease volume as competition approaches, this program continues to increase volume, peaking in week 5. this approach aims to enhance the athlete's work capacity, which is especially beneficial for novice throwers focused on building overall strength and size. the trade-off of maintaining higher volume closer to competition is made with the understanding that the target athlete is not yet highly competitive on the field and will benefit more from increased work capacity and strength gains.

exercise selection:
in the gym, deadlifts and push presses are prioritized over squats and bench presses due to their greater carryover to highland games events. these main lifts utilize a combination of amrap (as many reps as possible) sets and repeated effort sets. the intensity and volume of these exercises follow a specific pattern throughout the program, gradually increasing in both aspects.

accessory work:
accessories target chest and triceps for upper body, and hamstrings and quads for lower body. these exercises are performed at rpe 7 (rate of perceived exertion) with sets of 12-15 reps. the volume of accessory work varies significantly throughout the program, peaking in week 5 to create an overreaching effect and build maximal work capacity.

program intensity:
the fifth week of the program is particularly challenging, with high volume in both main lifts and accessories. this week is designed to push the athlete's limits and may result in extreme fatigue. following this intense week, the volume drops off rapidly to allow for recovery and peak intensity before the competition.

target audience:
this program is best suited for weekend throwers or those who prioritize overall strength gains as a means to improve their highland games performance. it may not be ideal for advanced throwers or those primarily focused on technique improvement. athletes looking to enhance their technical skills may need to add an additional throwing day and modify the gym portions accordingly.

customization:
this program covers most highland games events but excludes the caber toss. this event can be added as needed.","['novice', 'intermediate']",['bodybuilding'],full gym,7.0,80.0,145,2024-09-04 12:53:00,2025-06-18 08:13:00,65.33333333333333

homemade meat program,"i wanted a program that would suit my needs as a home gym owner, and my own personal goals. wanted to pack meat on the upper body, and get some good strength in the lower body, but be able to do sprints, cardio, and play some sports without having to carry concrete legs around. so here is homemade meat.

powerbuilding style upper body, and strength based lower body. giant sets for smaller muscle groups to maximise efficiency and get sickening pumps. all completed in 4 sessions a week.

gym requirements
squat rack
adjustable bench
barbell
ez-curl bar
dumbbells (i use the big collar dumbbells)
pull up bar
dip bar
weight belt (for weighted chins and dips)
other gym essentials (chalk, sleeves, straps etc).
i wrote this program based on my available equipment, but with any home gym, swap out the exercises or make adjustments so it can accommodate your equipment. 

time tested lifts, heavy compounds, neck and core work. 
supersets and giant sets to get the work done.

frequency
4 sessions per week. mon tues thurs fri, or whatever suits your schedule.

session length
around 70 minutes with proper rest.

rest times
heavy compounds: 2-3 minutes between each set.
supersets: 2-3 minutes between each superset.
giant sets: the smaller muscle group work is done in giant set fashion. three exercises after another and rest. 1:30-2 minute rest in between, get the metabolite build up going, huge pump, sickening gains.

top sets and back offs
you will see some top sets, where it's 1 set of a low rep and then 2-3 back off sets. great way to figure out the weight for your back offs is to take 15%-20% off your top set and work with that. 

rpe based intenisty
rate of perceived exertion, put simply:
rpe10: couldn't have done another rep, complete failure
rpe9 - 1 rep left or a little more weight
rpe8 - 2 reps left
rpe7 - etc

technique
controlled eccentrics, explosive concentric. if there is a pause programmed, give it a good pause. 

progression
use the rpe scale to track progression. if in week 1 you did 60kg bench for sets of 6 and at an rpe8, and 3 weeks later 60kg feels like an rpe6-7, then increase the weight for your working sets.

you can also progress by reps, starting at the lower end of the rep ranges and increasing over time with the same rpe or slightly higher. so long as the rpe is accurate and you aren't lollygagging, progress will follow. 

testing
block 3 calls for some rep maxes and then back off sets. see what you're made of and give these sets a crack. record your weights, repeat the program and see if you make progress.

calories
the superset and giant sets are demanding. get those calories in. 1.6g of protein per kg of bodyweight, good carbs, healthy fats, meat won't make itself.

pack on some homemade meat, and i hope you enjoy my program.","['novice', 'intermediate', 'advanced']","['bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",garage gym,12.0,70.0,168,2024-06-12 03:28:00,2025-06-18 10:35:00,98.0

on lower body days, you’ll focus on explosive olympic lifts like snatches and clean & jerks, paired with heavy squats and accessory movements targeting posterior chain strength. upper body days are built around high-skill calisthenics like muscle-ups, handstand push-ups, and dips, allowing you to build bodyweight control alongside raw strength.

the program uses an rpe-based progression to help you safely increase intensity each week, with the final week pushing you to your limits. by the end of four weeks, you’ll see improvements in your power, stability, and control, with a body that’s stronger, more agile, and better conditioned to face the next challenge.","['novice', 'intermediate']","['bodybuilding', 'powerlifting', 'powerbuilding']",garage gym,4.0,60.0,84,2024-11-09 01:36:00,2025-06-18 11:24:00,28.0

hybrid mma + bodybuilding upper posterior workout program,"build muscle and strength while training for mma or any other fighting training.

program structure:
monday - posterior/legs and back
tuesday - upper/chest, shoulders, and arms
wednesday - cardio/mma/fight training 
thursday - posterior/legs and back
friday - upper/chest, shoulders, and arms
saturday - cardio/mma/fight training 
sunday - rest

consistency:
stay consistent, try not to skip workouts.

how to progress:
start on the lower rep range then progress in more reps until on the highest rep, add weight then repeat.
for example:
on a 3x4-8
week 1 bench press 3x4 200lb
week 2 bench press 3x6 200lb
week 3 bench press 3x7 200lb
week 4 bench press 3x8 200lb
week 5 bench press 3x4 210lb

rest:
rest between 2-4 minutes on compound lifts, 1-3 on isolation lifts, and 30 sec to 2 min on supersets.

diet:
eat a high protein, and high to moderate calories for maximum strength and size gain.

sleep:
sleep between 7-9 hours of sleep a night for physical and mental health.

exercise form:
preform each exercise with the right form, slow eccentric, strong tight steady motion, focusing on the stretched position.

effort:
you need to put in some effort in training to see good results. both effort in how to train, being consistent, and preforming high intensity training in the exercises. try to stick with the rpe in the program, but if you know what you are doing you can go closer to failer or even farther if you know it's too much. but most people are farther from failure then they think. so just train hard and stick to it the best you can.
what is rpe?
rpe/rate of perceived exhaustion is a scale of how close you are to failing a lift.
[rpe 1] you can do 9 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 2] you can do 8 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 3] you can do 7 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 4] you can do 6 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 5] you can do 5 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 6] you can do 4 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 7] you can do 3 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 8] you can do 2 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 9] you can do 1 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 10] you can't do any more reps no matter what



important keys to maximum strength and size:
1. consistency
2. progression
3. rest
3. diet
4. sleep
5. exercise form
6. effort

this is a 4-day hybrid strength, calisthenics, and hypertrophy program designed for intermediate to advanced athletes who want to build elite-level bodyweight strength (planche, front lever, handstand, weighted muscle-up) while maintaining or increasing maximal strength in powerlifting movements. 
each workout seamlessly integrates skill work, compound lifts, and smart hypertrophy volume—all in one session.
goals:
1. build and refine advanced calisthenic skills [planche, front lever(fl), hand stand(hs),muscle up(mu)]
2. maintain/build maximal strength
3. target key muscle groups for hypertrophy
4. improve bodyweight-to-strength ratio
5. reduce cns fatigue and joint overuse risk

weekly schedule (4 days):
day 1: push strength + planche & handstand + chest/shoulders hypertrophy
day 2: pull strength + weighted muscle-up + back/biceps hypertrophy
day 3: push volume + planche/hs + triceps/shoulders hypertrophy
day 4: front lever + posterior chain and legs hypertrophy

block format:
4-week mesocycles
week 4: deload (reduce volume by 40–50%)(use week to recover joints, connective tissue, cns)
progress by adding reps, sets, or weight weekly within rir 1–2

hybrid strength x calisthenics skill,"welcome to the ultimate hybrid program—designed for the serious athlete who refuses to choose between brute strength and bodyweight mastery.

hybrid strength x calisthenics skill is a 4-day/week program for intermediate to advanced lifters, with a bit of calisthenics experience, who want to simultaneously get stronger in compound lifts, master elite calisthenics skills (planche, front lever, handstand, muscle-up), and develop a lean, muscular physique. whether you're a climber, powerlifter, or bodyweight athlete, this program will take your performance to the next level.

program goals:
-build advanced calisthenic skills (planche, front lever, handstand, weighted muscle-up)
-increase absolute strength in compound barbell lifts
-develop balanced muscular hypertrophy across all major muscle groups
-improve your power-to-weight ratio for climbing, athleticism, or aesthetics
-enhance mobility, control, and joint integrity for long-term performance

weekly schedule (4 days):
day 1: push strength + skill (planche + handstand) + upper hypertrophy
day 2: pull strength + skill (muscle-up) + upper hypertrophy
day 3: lower body strength + handstand skill + posterior chain hypertrophy
day 4: pull volume + skill (front lever) + arm & core hypertrophy

block format:
-4-week mesocycles
-week 4 is a deload (reduced volume and intensity)
-weekly progression in reps, sets, or load while keeping rir 1–2 on most working sets

progression principles:
-use rir 1–2 for working sets. increase reps/weight weekly within rep ranges.

focused block: 2–3 training cycles (each training block known as a mesocycles last week 6-8 weeks) 

---

goal  
this focused block is all about building **muscle size and structure** in a way that sets you up for future strength. when your muscles are developed in the right places — your quads, glutes, hamstrings, back, chest, and shoulders — you create a stronger base to lift heavier and move more powerfully in the next phase of training.  

it’s about building muscle that’s*strong, capable, and functional.

---
 key features

rep ranges: 
sets of 5–10 reps — enough load to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth, while still reinforcing good technique and strength.

exercise selection:
you’ll focus on full-body compound movements that target the main drivers of strength:

- squat variations: leg press, belt squat  
- hip hinges: romanian deadlifts (rdl), trap bar deadlifts, hip thrusts  
- pressing variations: barbell bench press, dumbbell bench press, overhead press  
- pulling variations: rows, pull-ups, pulldowns  
- carries & loaded core work: farmer’s carries, plank variations (front plank, side plank, copenhagen plank)

isolation work is included only if it helps reinforce strength or address weak points.

training volume:
slightly higher than a standard strength phase, but still manageable within, 2–3 full-body sessions per week.  
target 8–15 hard sets per muscle group per week, mostly through compound lifts.

progression methods: 
you’ll track progress by adjusting:
- volume (adding sets as needed)
- reps (working toward the top of your target range)
- load (gradually increasing weight used)

effort (rir – reps in reserve):
most sets are performed at 1–3 rir, meaning you stop each set with 1 to 3 good reps left in the tank.

- rir 3: moving well, could do 3 more reps  
- rir 2: working hard, but in control  
- rir 1: near max effort, just 1 clean rep left

this keeps intensity high without pushing you into burnout.

---

why this works
- builds **lean, functional muscle** to support heavier lifts later  
- focuses on muscles that **directly impact strength**  
- improves **work capacity and muscle recovery**  
- keeps workouts efficient — **no fluff, all function**

---

 common mistakes to avoid
- doing too much variety — stick to the basics and progress them  
- going to failure every set — leaves you fried with no room to grow  
- overloading isolation work — keep the focus on the compound lifts  
- under-recovering — with 2–3 focused sessions per week, recovery is part of the plan",['intermediate'],['bodybuilding'],full gym,6.0,40.0,96,2025-03-28 04:22:00,2025-06-18 09:28:00,28.0
hypertrophy (for strength) mesocycle # 1,"**the three kinds of strength training**
1. **hypertrophy (for strength)**  2-3 training cycles
   - sets of 5-10  
   - exercises that grow the most muscle but convert well to strength moves  
   - slightly higher volumes  

2. **basic strength**  2-3 training cycles
   - sets of 3-6  
   - exercises that increase strength the most, and are very similar (or same as) competition/outcome exercises but  
   - normal strength training volumes  

3. **peaking phase**  1 training cycle
   - sets of 1-3  
   - sets of 3-6 rpe 3-6 for technique between hard sessions  
   - mostly competition exercises  
   - loads go from rpe 7 to rpe 9  
   - last week only rpe 3-6  
   - volume progress from strength volumes to no training, then you’re ready to show off  

---------------------------------------------

**phase potentiation**

1. put on muscle (with hypertrophy phase)  
2. make muscle stronger (with basic strength phase)  
3. peak for max performance (with peaking phase)  
4. take an active rest phase  
   - 1-3 weeks of super easy or no formal training to heal up  
5. repeat!  

**note:**

hypertrophy progression series: advanced,"the hypertrophy progression series program is a fitness program designed to take you from a beginner to advanced level lifter.

while programmed as a 12 week block, i encourage you to think of it as 3, 4 week mesocycles wherein at the end of each meso you may swap out exercises as you see fit to increase or decrease volume for muscle group as needed or simply give a muscle group more work if its a target area of yours.

all exercises with an alternative movement will have a note attached with the reps for that movement, if no reps are specified it means reps remain the same for the alternate movement.

all bridging tiers of the program are designed to be run over a shorter period of time at 6 weeks per program or 2, 3 week mesocycles.

regarding the advanced program:
the split is a 5 times per week, 3 upper, 2 lower body program. should you choose to advance beyond this program onto my advanced+ programs you will be well prepared for the volume offered in those programs.

finally we come to the first of my programs designed to build a specific physique, this program particularly is designed after tom hardy's bane physique.

some movements in this program are marked: '(a)' or '(b)' in this case you will pick the movement to do and continue following the corresponding movements with your initial pick marking all alternate movements as skipped.

unless specified otherwise all sets are to be performed at 9rpe or 1rir.

you will not achieve the desired end goal of this program unless you are eating in a caloric surplus. this is not a cutting program.

regarding deloads:
from this point forward you will incorporate strategic deload weeks into your mesocycle. as a rule of thumb weeklong failure to match or progress on your primary lift at the start of each workout constitutes taking a deload week.
on this week you will halve all sets you perform prioritizing keeping your heavier rep range sets, and you will cut all weight down to 75% of your previous week.
for example if last week you did 4 sets of seal rows supersetted with tricep pushdowns you will cut to 2 sets and if you did 60kg on seal rows this week you will do 45kg, 40kg on pushdowns = 30kg this week.

i'm really fat and i want to lose weight! (ep 1),"my weight is above 150kg. i am really fat. i can do light cardio like treadmill but i can't do leg workout because my body doesn't support it. so this program is the first step to lose weight without injuring myself.

start with walking on the treadmill but never jog or run as it will hurt your knees and feet. slowly regain your stamina over the weeks.

muscle training is important so that you don't lose muscle mass during your weight loss period. eat enough protein too like chicken. 

for weight and muscle training, start with the weight that you can do but not over your limit. keep it consistent for few weeks, and then try to increase the weight.

if you are able to do legs, do add machine assisted legs workout.

rest between each day. do not overexert yourself. you can have the weekend free.

invincible,"this program is aimed at people with at least 1 year of experience with the 4 main lifts (bench press, overhead press, deadlift, squat) and wanting to combine powerlifting with bodybuilding.

arms are not a priority in most powerbuilding programs, this is why there is a separate arms day every week.

it will get you stronger and bigger.

days per week:4

program split: full body - upper - lower - arms/shoulders

how to run the program: full body - (rest) - upper - lower - arms/shoulders - (rest) - (rest)

progression:
main lifts(bench,squat, deadlift,ohp): you start with the prescribed % of the 1rm and you continue the next week adding 5lbs(2.5kgs) or increasing the reps(from 3 to 4)
when you notice that you hardly can progress, recalculate your increased 1rm and start over with 4 sets of 4 reps with the prescribed % of the 1rm(75% ,or 72% for ohp)

other lifts: just try to progressively overload over time, while sticking to the rep ranges.

ishp-3: instinctive strength & hypertrophy,"ishp-3: instinctive strength & hypertrophy progression (3-day cycle)

for the student with little time, for the dad who has no time, and for anyone who needs an effective, quick, and few-days-per-week routine.

promote muscle hypertrophy (muscle growth) by utilizing a high-frequency, high-intensity, low-volume approach to training. 

based on a gradual increase in weight and controlled repetition ranges, which makes it ideal for beginners and intermediates who are still developing strength. the use of increments each week allows users to progressively overload their muscles without jumping too quickly into heavier weights.

low volume with high frequency: beginners often struggle with overtraining or improper technique when they use high-volume workouts. this program limits sets to 1-2 per exercise, ensuring that users focus on quality over quantity while getting the benefits of frequent stimulation.

1. determine your 1rm

before starting, you need to know your 1rm for each of the major lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift, etc.). you can either directly test your 1rm or use an online 1rm calculator based on a weight you can lift for x reps.

2. progression :

weeks 1-2 (high reps): use 65-70% of your 1rm for 12-15 reps per set.
weeks 3-4 (moderate reps): use 75-80% of your 1rm for 8-10 reps per set.
weeks 5-6 (low reps): use 85-90% of your 1rm for 4-6 reps per set.
weeks 7-8 (strength focus): use 90-95% of your 1rm for 1-3 reps per set.

3 increase weight gradually: each week,  the weight increases by 2.5-5% for each exercise. this gradual overload ensures continuous progress while avoiding injury.

reps drop as weight increases: as you increase the percentage of your 1rm, the number of reps you can complete will naturally decrease. this is normal and part of the program’s design.

4. rest periods

as you increase the weight and lower the reps, allow for longer rest periods (2-3 minutes) between sets, especially during the strength-focused weeks (weeks 7-8).

5. workout frequency

the routine is performed three times a week with rest days in between (e.g., monday, wednesday, friday). you can do light cardio on rest days, but avoid heavy lifting to allow for recovery.

6. recovery weeks

after completing a full 8-week cycle, take a one-week break to let your body recover.

understanding rpe 6

rpe 6 is a moderate intensity level. if you’re performing a set with a weight that you can lift for 8 reps, at rpe 6, you should feel like you could comfortably do 4 more reps if needed.
this level is ideal for volume work or in the early stages of your routine when you’re still warming up and building strength without pushing to failure. 

f you're consistently hitting the target reps and the weight feels light (rpe 6 or lower), it's a sign to increase the load.","['intermediate', 'advanced']",['muscle & sculpting'],full gym,8.0,60.0,240,2024-10-10 02:37:00,2025-06-18 08:16:00,56.0

intermediate girlboss! hlm 3x full body,"the continuation of the novice girlboss program.

rules:
you need to be at least early intermediate to run this program.
!! only run this program when the novice program stops working and:
a) you have tried bulking up and still don't progressively overload
b) you have tried upping your protein intake and still do not progressively overload.

rest periods on the heavy and medium days are 2-3mins, supersets are mandatory pretty much.
light day rest periods are 1-1.5mins and supersets are not mandatory as the rest periods make it shorter.

this program is designed with the female body in mind. it is structured with the heavy light medium system to maximise useful volume and frequency, minimise joint fatigue and optimise hypertrophy. 

in order for a fullbody program to work variety is essential.
so we vary the exercises, the reps and also the rest periods.

heavy days = heavy compounds, low reps, long rest
light days= isolations (for joint health and recovery), high reps, short rest
medium days = medium compounds (hypertrophy focused and more joint friendly than the ones on the h day), medium reps, medium rest.

if you change things around the whole system falls apart.
it's a brutally effective system to sculpt your dream body.

it's a constant work in progress.
any feedback is more than welcome!

iron monk powerbuilding u/l,"15 week long, 4 times per week upper/lower program, which aims to maximize hypertrophy while building strength in the squat, bench, deadlift, and pullup.

the program consists of 3 5-week phases, with top sets of 6, 3, and 1 reps, respectively. backdown sets are percentage based and fashioned in a reverse pyramid style. volume increases, then decreases within each phase, while intensity steadily increases through the phase and program. a focus on hypertrophy is maintained throughout the program, but secondary and accesory lifts become more specific as the program progresses.

important note on pullups. the program also aims to develop back strength and size through a stronger weigted pull-up. any grip, variation, or regression may be used. alternatively, the pull-up can be replaced with barbell rows. in such 5 moving the rows to after the deadlift say in your training week.

phase one utilizes high repetitions with compound movements to improve work capacity and hypertrophy. secondary movements used for sbd are: hack squats, larsen press, and good mornings.

phase two consists of more moderate volume and intensity. new secondary and bodybuilding movements are intoduced. secondary movements used for  sbd are: ssb squat, close grip bench, and romainian deadlifts.

phase three are most strength specific and tapers to new one rep maces, including the weighted pull up. secondary movements used for sbd are: high bar squats, paused bench press, and stiff legged deadlifts.

*bodybuilding movements are progressed through double progression
* percentages are not set in stone and can be altered with 1-2%. stronger lifters can consider reducing the percentage

jay cutler style high volume workout program,"jay cutler style high volume workout program

overview:
this high-volume workout program, inspired by legendary bodybuilder jay cutler, is designed to progressively increase your training volume over time to maximize muscle growth and endurance. this program combines compound and isolation movements with strategic rest periods to ensure optimal recovery and performance.

key features:

progressive volume increase: each week, the total volume of your workouts will incrementally increase. this progression ensures continuous muscle stimulation and adaptation, driving hypertrophy and strength gains.

structured rest periods:

for compound movements (e.g., squats, deadlifts, bench press), take 90-120 seconds of rest between sets. this allows for adequate recovery while maintaining intensity.
for isolation movements (e.g., bicep curls, tricep extensions), rest for 45-60 seconds between sets. shorter rest periods in these exercises will keep the muscle under constant tension and enhance the pump.

training to 1 rir (reps in reserve): to prevent overtraining and injury, you will not train to failure. instead, each set should be taken to about 1 rir, meaning you should have one more rep left in the tank. this approach promotes sustainable progress and muscle growth without excessive fatigue.

progressive overload strategy:

each week, slightly increase the weight or the number of reps for each exercise. monitor your progress and ensure you're steadily increasing the workload to keep challenging your muscles.

important tips:

- maintain proper form and technique to prevent injury.
- ensure you're following a balanced diet rich in protein, carbs, and healthy fats to support muscle recovery and growth.
- get adequate sleep and hydration to optimize your performance and recovery.

this high-volume workout program will push your limits and help you build a physique reminiscent of jay cutler's. stay consistent, listen to your body, and watch as you achieve incredible gains over time.",['advanced'],"['athletics', 'bodyweight fitness', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,8.0,80.0,232,2024-05-26 05:40:00,2025-06-18 11:14:00,74.66666666666667

kizen infinite off-season & deload,"this program is a auto-regulated powerlifting program for your off-season that will help you add a lot of strength and utilizes our methodology of sub-max training to constantly progress while avoiding injury.

it's 4 days a week of training and uses amrap sets to adjust the weight for the following week so you can continue progressing and avoid plateaus.

if you are an intermediate lifter (have at least one year lifting experience) and are not yet advanced (deadlift over 600lb, squat over 500lb etc), this training program should be highly effective. we don't recommend this program for novice lifters, as it is very specific to powerlifting and novices should look to build overall strength.

the concept is simple; based upon your performance week to week, the program automatically adjusts what you do the following week. we do this by assessing your performance on your top set, known as your amrap set. amrap stands for as many reps as possible. in this way the program manages your fatigue.

the problem with a program that gives strict percentages for 10-12 weeks is that sometimes life happens. you get stressed, have exams, personal issues etc that interfere with your training. with self regulation, no matter what your stress level, you can get the appropriate training effect with the program.

also, if you're feeling absolutely banged up, we've included an optional deload week that can help get you back on track and training with the appropriate weights.",['intermediate'],['powerbuilding'],full gym,5.0,90.0,121,2024-05-25 11:56:00,2025-06-25 03:29:00,52.5

while you can certainly go for 1-5 rep pr's, this program is tailored specifically to 1 rep attempts, as that's what worked best for me. the daily exercise selection uses a rotation schedule along with varied ranges of motion which can allow enough recovery time to go for pr's every day. in addition to the
max attempts it also includes back off work (extra sets/reps on the same lift with less weight) and accessory work. both of these are optional, but it's highly recommended that they be added in occasionally based upon how recovered you're feeling.

despite the focus on recovery, the goal is not to be fully recovered at all times. fatigue should build over time. the best results have come when this program is run every day (or nearly every day) for around 3 weeks, followed by a deload week (where you either take the week off entirely or you significantly reduce the intensity of workouts to allow fatigue to dissipate. then after this deload run the program for another 1 to 2 weeks.

the main structure of the program is to do a max attempt on a pressing exercise to start the day, followed by optional back-off work using the same lift. next will be a lower body max attempt and optional back-off work and/or accessory work. you can of course change exercises as you see fit, but be aware that the exercise selection can have a large impact on fatigue buildup. adjust accordingly. take a

kratos | physique and strength of the god of war,"“kratos” is built to forge a strong, muscular upper body through a combination of strength training and hypertrophy work. each session is made to grow size where it counts. chest, delts, arms, and back will all be hammered, (legs will still be a part of the program) while developing the raw strength to prove it. it’s not just about looking like a god-slayer, but having the strength of one.
———————————
the ideal way to run “kratos” is to do all three blocks, although, you can choose to run singular blocks instead.

block 1 - block 1 takes a both hypertrophy and strength-based approach. this is the main block of the program that defines mass and strength put together into one block.

block 2 - block 2 focuses on more of a hypertrophy progression, while having it’s main focus put towards mass. the muscular growth from this block should be the most significant.

look like you lift - torso/limbs split,"a torso/limbs split is a popular bodybuilding modification to the traditional upper/lower split. typically, the upper/lower split is designed for athletes. so, why do so many people who primarily want to ""look like you lift"" adopt the upper/lower approach?

because it strikes a great balance
it's a fantastic way to balance the gym with your life. training four days a week means you're in the gym more than you're not but still get weekends off, and you’re still hitting both your upper and lower body twice a week.

but why modify it?
as mentioned earlier, the upper/lower split wasn't originally designed with bodybuilding in mind. let’s be real for a second: why do we lift? to fill out a t-shirt. we lift to look like we lift.

the upper/lower split makes it harder to achieve that goal.
why?
the traditional upper/lower split forces you to train everything you need to fill that t-shirt in just two days. so, are we really expecting to put in maximum effort on our chest, upper back, lats, shoulders, biceps, triceps, and forearms with enough volume in just two days? no one enjoys slogging through a 2+ hour workout, only to begrudgingly hit the ez curl bars for some half-assed bicep curls at the end of an upper day.

so, two upper body days… but what about the other two days?
they’re just legs?
yeah… just legs. now, we all want big legs, but are we seriously going to dedicate the same amount of time to them as we would to the complex and aesthetically crucial upper body? it’s likely that your goal is to have well-defined legs that look like you lift—not necessarily gigantic legs.

so, what's the solution?
a torso/limbs split

with this modification, we shift isolation movements to our “limbs” day. this means the first day focuses on your torso (chest, back, abs, some shoulders), while the second day focuses on your limbs (biceps, triceps, lateral deltoids, quads, hamstrings, glutes).

now, we get the benefit of two arm days without needing to go to the gym six times a week. and unless legs are your top priority, there’s no need to dedicate two full days just to leg workouts. this also frees up more room on your torso day for torso-specific exercises.

schedule:
mon: torso 1
tue: limbs 1
wed: rest
thur: torso 2
fri: limbs 2
sat: rest/optional accessories (see week 4)
sun: rest

volume:
start with the lower end of set recommendations. adjust slowly after a couple weeks.

intensity:
everything should be taken to or very close to failure in a deep rom.

superset when possible. feel free to modify for your needs.

recommended schedule:
monday: back
tuesday: chest
wednesday: rest
thrusday: legs
friday: shoulder
saturday: arms
sunday: rest

note: weeks 4, 8, 12 & 16 are deload weeks — reduce volume and/or intensity to allow for recovery and adaptation. this is essential for long-term progress and injury prevention.

deload weeks (weeks 4, 8, 12 & 16):
purpose: recover from accumulated fatigue, reduce risk of injury, and promote long-term progress.

how:
1. cut volume by 30–50%.
2. use 50–70% of your usual training weights.
3. avoid failure (leave 2–3 reps in reserve).
4. focus on technique, tempo, and mobility.
5. optional: drop accessory/isolation work.

post-deload week (week 5, 9, 13 & 17):
purpose: ramp back up safely and smoothly.

how:
1. resume training at 80–90% of usual volume.
2. return to normal working weights, but keep 1 rep in reserve (rir).
3. increase weights by 2.5–5% only if you're feeling strong.

try to add 5 lbs to each main lift per week (or 2.5 lbs for rdls), deload only when you feel it's needed (it's unnecessary for this type of program unless you stall). avoid cardio on recovery days to maximize recovery and progress. focus on needed calories and protein for growth, use a cutting phase with a balanced routine after program completion as needed.

avoid adding any additional exercises, and especially no upper, but feel free to add sets or reps to the band workouts if desired, they are there to make sure you've completely hit the muscle group and supporting areas for the main lift. the goal is to maximize recovery potential to get the most change possible, add-on exercises will interfere with your progress. less is more when the goal is a rapid targeted change.

thank you!

lyle mcdonald’s generic bulking routine allows for a lot of flexibility within the program. if you are not comfortable with making some decisions within your training, then this program may not be for you. alternatively, this may be a good opportunity to learn how to experiment, learn, and adapt with respect to your training.

set and rep ranges
most exercises have sets and reps prescribed in ranges. for example, you will perform 3 to 4 sets of squats, each with 6 to 8 reps for the squat on lower body training days.

there are three different recommended set and rep ranges used in this routine:

3-4 sets of 6-8 reps (3 minute rest between sets)
2-3 sets of 10-12 reps (2 minutes rest between sets)
1-2 sets of 12-15 reps (90 seconds rest between sets)

lyle mcdonald says:
""3-4 sets means 3 to 4 sets. so after your third set, you need to make a judgement call. if i were
there coaching you, i”d make it for you. judging by how fatigued you looked on the third set,
what your reps looked like, how fried you looked. if you still looked strong, i’d have you do a 4th
set. if you looked fried, you’d stop at 3.""",[],[],full gym,12.0,90.0,1152,2025-05-16 11:23:00,2025-06-27 02:28:00,126.0

learn to perform lifts correctly.
focus on technique: good quality reps with excellent control.

warm ups

perform 1-3 ramp up sets before every compound lift.
perform 1 warm up set with lighter weight before every isolation lift.
do your warm up sets with as best technique as posible.

rest intervals

3 min between lower body compounds.
2 min between upper body compounds & isolations. 
1 min between conditioning exercises (dumbbell thrusters).

range of motion

perform as much range on motion as you can safely, mantaining good technique.

intensity

perform as many reps as you can with good technique.
if technique breaksdown stop the set.

progression - double progression

add reps until you hit the top of the rep range in both sets, then add weight.

for example, if you are doing:

- high bar squat 50kg x 4-4

you will add weight when you hit 50kg x 6-6 with good technique.

monkey man - street lifter program,"this program's made to increase strength in the squat, chin up/pull up, and dip with enough body building work to facilitate a well rounded look. basically a streetlifting program without the muscle up. 

monkey man consist of a 4 day upper lower split along with an optional pump day to pull up any weak links. this is split into 2 distinct phases. i recommend this program be run in a slight caloric surplus thought but a cut can be run in the last 4 weeks to maximize strength to weight ratios on the body weight movements. the first 4 week is focused on increasing muscle mass and getting good practice with relatively tough weights on the ""competition"" movements. the last 4 weeks are still ganna grow you but the volume gets lower and the rpe gets higher. this should allow for a minor prs after running the program once and should be a sustainable way to program for many months. 

on the pump day, feel free to chance the movements as you see fit, this is to shore up personal weaknesses. i recommend traditional fluffy bodybuilding work that wont interfere with the main movements of the program.  i also highly recommend 2-4 sessions of steady state cardio a week for general health benefits and to have a nice aerobic base to get thru the sessions quickly. 

*note- the pull up and squat get maxed out at the end of the 8 weeks but the dips are pushed for a 3rm. this is targeted at people new to heavy weighted dips. technique breakdown is very likely occur and relatively dangerous without proper practice. if you are running this for a second time or have experience with dips feel free to try for a 1rm.","['advanced', 'intermediate']","['bodybuilding', 'powerbuilding', 'powerlifting']",full gym,8.0,90.0,138,2025-03-13 10:41:00,2025-06-18 08:03:00,84.0

my program (s3),"stage 3

you are close to being an intermediate.
progression has probably slow down or even stalled.

-exercise selection 

if something is progressin well and you have no aches don`t change it.
although i think it's a good time to include some variation.

change exercises if: 

-you are no longer progressing (in any way, for at least 3-4 weeks).
-you are having persistent &/ worsening joint pain.
-you are experiencing excessive fatigue.
-you are getting significantly less stimulus than usual (pumps, tension, disruption...).

these are valid reasons to change an exercise, also you could consider changing for the sake of enjoyment/avoiding boredom.

-intensity

it's time to take it up a notch. 
you can go to failure/rir 0 on isolations often but maybe only on the last set.
experiment with going to failure/rir 0 on the last set of compound lifts occasionaly.
i don't recommend going to failure on squats or deadlifts/rdls.
you should  be able to gauge rir/rpe.

-progression

use overload autorregulation as described on stage 1. this progression method is thought to make you transition effortlessly onto intermediate.

some lifts could be progressing fine & others could be stallin.

on the lifts that are stallin you may want to transition to double progression or dynamic double progression.

you are closing onto intermediate, take your time to add weight, don't rush it, progress has slowed down and it is normal, don't get frustrated.

train consistently, follow the program, eat well & in a 200-300kcal surplus, sleep 8 hours & be sure that you are training hard & i guarantee you will progress. if you stagnate, make sure that you have this dialed in before making any changes.

once you check those boxes, use volume as a tool.

-volume

if you are progressing don't add volume.
you can manipulate other variables to progress.
if you are not progressing you can try adding volume & see if it works.

if you keep adding volume you will have to reduce the intensity, you can't do high volumes to failure every week for the same muscle group, it doesn't work.

-rest intervals

3-4 min between compounds.
1-2 min between isolations.

-warm ups

do as many ramping sets as needed before each lift. more weight usually needs more warm up sets.

warm up sets should feel fairly easy.

-finally

do not modify the program parameters.  

run this program for as long as you are progressing on it. 
if you are progressing fine i wouldn't change anything.",['advanced'],"['powerbuilding', 'bodybuilding', 'athletics']",full gym,12.0,120.0,228,2025-02-10 05:04:00,2025-06-18 07:48:00,168.0

malone beginner strength,"this program is for those who are looking for a resistance program but don’t know where to start or do not have a lot of equipment. you don’t need a full gym to workout. i did add a few exercises that require a resistance band. also, as with any workout, scale it for your own training. some people are stronger than others. there is no one size fits all. 

this will be a 3 times a week program.  the best way to approach is to have a day off between workouts. (ex day 1 monday, day 2 wednesday, day 3 friday). the off days can be completely off or cardio of choice, stretching, mobility work, etc) 

weeks 1-4 will increase in reps slightly. 
week 5 will be a recovery week
weeks 6-8 will increase the sets and reps slightly 
the gradual progression is a smart way to approach any plan. don’t dive into the deep end right away. you need to ease it but it’s worth it.

it also throws in 2 days of steady state cardio. these days should not be very hard. choose any form of cardio you wish such as running, biking, hiking, rowing, or anything that can be held at a steady pace to build the healthy heart benefits. choose a starting time for week 1 and add 5 minutes each week. don’t overshoot the start time. if you haven’t done cardio in a long time, aim for the low end to start.

mania (upper/lower),"mania is a 4 day per week training program that primarily focuses on hypertrophy and general strength. this is for those who want to build muscle and like training but also like to have their rest days. mania is built with the novice lifter in mind, but is effective enough for an intermediate to see progress. 

like the title says, this program is an upper/lower split, meaning that you will train lower body muscles twice per week and your upper body muscles twice per week. three days during the week are rest days. during those rest days, prehab, static stretching, and cardio can be done as active recovery. the split goes as follows: l/u/rest/l/u/rest/rest. the idea is that if you start the program on a monday, you will have the weekend to rest. this also gives time between lower days, as those take time to recover from.

the main expectation is that you train hard. intensity is the name of the game for this program as the amount of sets isn't particularly high. you should be pushing until you can't get another rep out while you are in the prescribed rep ranges. if you think you can do more than the prescribed rep ranges, that is a sign to add more weight. if you are constantly at the higher end of the rep ranges for an exercise, it is time to increase the weight. if you are not meeting the rep range on an exercise, you're obviously going too heavy.

this goes without saying but technique is important as you increase your weight and intensity. sacrificing form to horse that last rep could lead to a one-way ticket to snap city. we obviously don't want that. boostcamp provides technique videos paired with each exercise, so if you're unsure on how to do an exercise, click on the exercise you are doing and the video will be directly linked. 

moreover,  the negative portions of each exercise should be controlled. slower negatives are better for muscle growth. negatives should be about 2-4 seconds depending on the exercise. for example, it would be harder to control the negative on a squat than on a leg extension. 

that's about it. get jacked and stacked!",[],[],full gym,12.0,90.0,288,2024-07-21 06:57:00,2025-06-18 09:11:00,126.0

faq:

are supersets mandatory?
-> the supersets are primarily there to save time. if a particular superset is not possible, split the individual exercises up into standard sets. 

is the order of the exercises important?
-> yes and no. while it is a good idea to keep the order of the exercises for the most part, this mainly applies to compound lifts and does not necessarily apply to isolation exercises.

how much rest time should there be between sets?
-> whatever feels right. resting too long is bad, but it's better than resting too short because the program gave an arbitrary number.

is the amount of sets mandatory?
-> no, especially for less advanced lifters. feel free to reduce the amount of sets if necessary. it is recommended you train sets to failure, and 4 or even 3 sets might not always be feasible. 

can exercises be switched to different ones?
-> yes, that's always possible. if you decide to switch any exercises with a similar one, make sure to adjust rep ranges. for example: 
squat 4×4-8 -> hack squat 4×10-15
deadlift 3×3-5 -> snatch deadlift 3×6-10

should there be additional work besides the program?
-> the program should be quite taxing on the body and ensures that just about every muscle group important for bodybuilding is hit regularly. however, cardio is highly encouraged, whereever it fits into the daily schedule.

should the program be run on a bulk?
-> the program works best when ran on a (perma-)bulk, while staying at a reasonable bodyfat percentage, between 12-20%, think bearmode.

can strength gains be expected?
-> the program is designed for pure bodybuilding purposes. still, heavy compounds are included, suggesting some strength gains.

what to do when the 12 weeks are over?
-> the program is designed to be run indefinitely. run the program from the beginning or find another program if you didn't like this one. if you feel the need to cut, try to see how the program feels.",['novice'],['muscle & sculpting'],full gym,12.0,90.0,300,2024-01-08 11:27:00,2025-06-30 02:19:00,126.0

"masscraft: push, pull, legs, core","1. muscle building (hypertrophy)
each workout targets major muscle groups with 3–4 compound and isolation exercises.

reps are in the 8–12 range, ideal for muscle growth.

volume and frequency are balanced to stimulate muscle fibers effectively without overtraining.

2. strength gains
big lifts like bench press, squats, deadlifts, and overhead press train multiple muscles and nervous system efficiency.

low to moderate rep ranges (6–10) on these compound movements help increase your base strength.

3. balanced physique
split ensures all muscle groups are hit evenly:

push day: chest, shoulders, triceps

pull day: back, biceps

legs day: quads, hamstrings, calves

core day: abdominals and core stability

this avoids imbalances and helps with posture, aesthetics, and injury prevention.

4. recovery-friendly
4 days/week with rest days in between lets muscles recover and grow.

smart scheduling (push–pull–rest–legs–core–rest–rest) promotes recovery while keeping intensity high.

max ot ft high carb,"> max-ot: - most reps are 4-6 reps and heavy > high carb: - 10-20*weight food from glucose (depending on muscle mass and level of activity during the day) 
>max-ot: - very heavy weights, practice 4-6 reps - pressure time is from 15-25 seconds -> mainly uses atp-cp and lactic acid energy systems -> the fuel used is glycogen - -> suitable for high carb glucose. 

advantage: *max-ot > short training session of 45-60 minutes > use heavy weights, increase nerves and get high *high-carb > cheap because you don't need to eat a lot of protein > suitable for people who exercise a lot and do manual work > muscles are always bulging and tearing  

defect: *max-ot > easily injured if practiced carelessly > easily overtrained, causing mental fatigue, insomnia, and irritability > therefore, you must pay attention to careful training, good nutrition, and good recovery *high carb > if you eat more than 1000g of rice, there is a risk of arsenic poisoning > must eat 2 or more carbohydrate sources of glucose > micronutrient deficiency if not eating a diverse diet to overcome the disadvantages: > cardio every day to increase recovery > flexibility training and loaded stretch > practice one single set to failure, the remaining sets to near failure with beautiful technique 

general notes: > must have 50 warm-up reps in the first exercise > must have 25 reps to warm up in exercise two > 3 warm ups so you can pause at the top and bottom for 1 second > 1 hardset of full rom until failure -> click -> hold for 3 seconds -> click one last time > rest time: 90-180s / set or until you feel confident > practice must end 60 minutes before the first set cardio (extremely important): > start with incline 0, speed 4, 10 minutes > increase each day 1-2 inclines, 0.1-0.2 speed, 1-2 minutes > up to slope 15, 30-60 minutes/session > don't do too much in the beginning as it will exhaust your mental stamina and risk accumulating fatigue when you're not used to it. > doing something easy every day is better than trying it for a short time and then giving up > at least 4 cardio sessions per week, including post-workout cardio. stretching (extremely important): > stretching helps increase active rom (active range of motion) > indirectly increase muscle, prevent injury > lower body: choose horizontal splits / vertical splits > upper body: select human bridge 

supplement should be given priority (you can use it or not): 1. magnesium bisglycinate 600mg per day, divided equally after exercise and before bed > glycine root helps calm nerves and increase recovery > helps sleep well, increases recovery 2. creatine 3-5g anytime > increase strength and muscle swelling 3. d3 >increases overall health and hormones 4. omega 3 coq10 4-6 tablets divided equally into meals > increase cardiovascular endurance > absorb fat-soluble vitamins 5. b vitamins and theanine: 1-2v per day at any time > helps relax and restore nerves","['novice', 'intermediate']",['bodyweight fitness'],full gym,12.0,60.0,336,2024-03-01 06:16:00,2025-06-18 09:10:00,84.0

progressive overload is the cornerstone of building strength/muscle. most efficient way to progressive overload is via ""double progression"". a rep range (e.g. 3-5) would be an example of double progression:

mike mentzer heavy duty program,"created by mike mentzer (1951 – 2001)—as much philosopher as he was bodybuilder—the heavy duty method is one that incorporates high-intensity training along with lower rep ranges and heavier weights. even during the time, mentzer’s thinking went against the grain, both in terms of his lifting and his diet.

we’ve taken a closer look at the mind behind this training philosophy, and the things that led up to it. it’s definitely going to gas out your muscles and get you results.

while arthur jones advocated for one set of 20 reps per exercise, mike mentzer’s workout concluded that the ideal rep range was 6-8. however, on the last rep you would be reaching absolute muscular failure, and it did not stop there. mike mentzer’s workout involved going beyond failure (a philosophy also adopted by tom platz), utilizing forced reps, negative reps, rest-pause, and pre-exhaust supersets.","['intermediate', 'novice', 'advanced']","['bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",full gym,4.0,30.0,24,2024-02-08 10:39:00,2025-06-18 09:29:00,14.0
mike mentzer on the bells of steel cable tower,"mike mentzer's training principles often involve high-intensity, low-volume workouts. here's a simple workout routine for you using the bells of steel cable tower:

note that the reps for this training protocol are 2-2-4. 2 second concentric, 2 second pause, 2 second eccentric. 

these exercises will be 1-2 sets done to failure within a 6-8 rep range. if you do manage to break 12 reps, increase the weight by 10% and go back to 6 reps. 

remember to warm up before each session and cool down afterward. adjust the weight to ensure you reach muscle failure within the specified rep range. rest 1-2 minutes between sets and 2-3 minutes between exercises. listen to your body, and progress gradually by increasing the resistance as you get stronger.",['intermediate'],"['athletics', 'bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",full gym,12.0,60.0,185,2024-02-22 09:45:00,2025-06-22 11:31:00,84.0
mike mentzer's full body routine,"this program is designed to build muscle through high-intensity training techniques.

the program is recommended for beginners by mike mentzer in his instructional video about heavy duty training and is designed secondarily to familiarize the beginner with the basic weightlifting movements. however, mentzer notes that advanced trainees can benefit from this program as well.

mentzer recommends a training strategy which is slightly unconventional. each exercise (with few exceptions) should be taken to momentary muscular failure in all three phases of the movement: the concentric (positive) phase, the contracted (static phase), and the eccentric (negative) phase.

for example, when performing the underhand lat pulldown, the trainee should perform repetitions until he can no longer perform a full contraction. this constitutes positive failure. then the trainee should use momentum, help from his training partner, or some other form of assistance to perform a full contraction and hold the weight in the contracted position until he can no longer maintain the static, contracted position. this constitutes static failure. then the trainee should use assistance to perform a full contraction and perform repetitions of the eccentric phase of the exercise under strict control until failure. this constitutes eccentric failure.

the prescribed rep ranges prescribe the number of repetitions it should take the trainee to reach positive failure. after reaching positive failure, the trainee should continue the exercise until both static and negative failure are achieved.

some exercises cannot be safely taken to static and/or negative failure, such as deadlifts, squats, etc. in these cases, the trainee should end his set after positive failure is reached. other exercises cannot benefit from the use of momentum to reach full contraction, such as many pressing movements. in these cases, the trainee should only take the set to static or negative failure if he has a training partner or some other way to reach full contraction without using momentum. the most certain way to prevent muscle growth is injury!",['intermediate'],"['athletics', 'bodybuilding']",full gym,4.0,40.0,108,2024-08-26 12:32:00,2025-06-18 11:25:00,18.666666666666668
mike mentzer’s 4-day program,"how to choose weight:

use a weight on the lower end of the rep range and complete the set. once you hit the upper end of the rep range, increase the weight by about 10 pounds and repeat



how to complete reps:

use the 4-2-4 method when lifting these weights to get maximum results. this means:

4 second lift, 2 second pause, 4 second lowering



notes from mike:

complete one workout every 96 hours.

warmup on the compound lift and only warmup as is necessary. you should have but one working set.

if you have barely, or not worked out at all in a long period of time, mentzer recommends less intense training sessions and learning proper form on the major exercises before beginning this training program. this should be a period of several months. 

always consult a physician prior to beginning any workout program.","['novice', 'beginner']",['bodybuilding'],full gym,1.0,50.0,8,2024-06-06 12:01:00,2025-06-18 10:02:00,5.833333333333333

how to run this program
frequency: complete both sessions within 7 days (ideally with 2–4 days between them).

progression: use rpe (rate of perceived exertion) to guide intensity. apply your preferred progression method (double progression, linear progression, etc.).

block structure: one block = 4 weeks. after 3 weeks, reassess your progress and adjust as needed.

flexibility: if you feel good and want extra work, add 3–6 exercises for 2–4 sets of 10–20 reps, or do some sandbag/conditioning work. this is optional and based on your energy.


how to progress
after 4 weeks (1 block), assess your lifts and recovery.

*novice/intermediate version

this bodybuilding workout plan is designed to facilitate weekly progressive overload through set volume while maintaining a moderate intensity level. by gradually increasing the volume of sets each week, you’ll challenge your muscles to adapt and grow over time, promoting continuous progress and muscle development.

this workout plan provides a balanced approach to bodybuilding, targeting all major muscle groups while systematically increasing training volume to promote muscle growth and strength gains over time.

if you have never done a particular exercise, pick a weight that you think will be appropriate for the prescribed reps at the prescribed rpe/rir.

begin each workout with a 5-10 minute warm up on an elliptical machine or treadmill. 

it is also recommended to do warm up sets before your working sets, especially with compound movements.   create a custom warm-up template with 3 sets.  

30% for 10 reps
50% for 5 reps
100% for 2 reps 

rest for 1 to 2 minutes between sets, depending on the type of exercise. use shorter rest periods for isolation exercises and longer ones for compound exercises.

on rest days, aim for active recovery by staying lightly active, such as going to the gym for mild weight training or opting for cardio exercises.

- feel free to swap exercises as long as they target the same muscle group and maintain the original exercise's complexity, whether compound or isolation.

- modify the repetition range and intensity (rpe/rir) 
as needed, aiming for a typical range of 8 to 12 reps for compound exercises and 10 to 16 reps for isolation exercises.

the program concludes with a deload week, aiming to reduce intensity and volume, allowing the body to fully recover. this approach aids in preventing overuse injuries and fostering long-term enhancements in strength and muscle growth.

after finishing the program, you can move on to the muscle builder 3 plan. if you feel you may be overtrained, consider the muscle builder resensitization plan and repeat the muscle builder 1 or 2 plan.",['intermediate'],['powerlifting'],full gym,6.0,60.0,140,2024-02-23 08:57:00,2025-06-18 09:30:00,42.0

this program follows a body part split, commonly known as a bro split, emphasizing intense focus on one muscle group per workout with ample rest before targeting it again the following week. while it is optimal to train muscle groups more frequently, each approach has its advantages and drawbacks. this plan is for those who prefer bro splits or anyone just seeking a change in their routine.

if you have never done a particular exercise, pick a weight that you think will be appropriate for the prescribed reps at the prescribed rpe/rir.

- select weights tailored to the prescribed reps and rpe. lower reps and higher rpe values indicate the use of heavier weights.

- allow 2-3 minutes of rest between exercises, with shorter rest periods for isolation exercises and longer intervals for compound movements.

- implement active rest between training days, engaging in moderate activities such as walking.

ndlv2,"a moderate frequency intensity accumulation program based on matt vena's old squat program.

i wanted a program that allowed me to squat and bench twice a week; and put deadlifts at the rear end. for my experience, training squats carries over to deadlifts since the very bottom of the deadlift requires a lot of quad strength (i pull conventional). for sumo pullers, the deadlift volume in this program might be way too little.

i added some deadlifts after squats such that there is still some practice with the deadlift, and limiting the fatigue with a maximum of rpe7. on the other squat day, weighted back extensions (45 degree) are used as the primary hinge movement to reduce axial fatigue.

in terms of linear progression, attempt to add 2.5kg/5lbs per block.

i also added some supersets (they are optional, dependent on gym) that you can try to attempt to reduce the amount of time in the gym.

attempt to keep maxes for paused and comp lifts the same.

nezumi-chan,"stage 1

if you are new to the gym this is your program. 
but if you have no sports/training experience at all you may want to check stage 0.

1) consistency is king - it is the most important thing & the fastest way to your goals.

2) technique - learn how to preform the lifts correctly.

3) intensity - learn how to train hard.

-exercise selection 

learn fundamental movement patterns (squat, hinge, push, pull) performing basic compound lifts & mastering technique on them as much as possible, isolation is not neglected.

i recommend that you start with the barbell basics such as bb squat, rdl, bb bench, pull ups & oh bb press if you can do them with a reasonable range of motion. if you can't, try an easier variation.

check stage 0 for recommended variations.

choose one lift for each movement pattern and stick to it.

-intensity

you shouldn't go to failure as a novice, specially on the big compound lifts.

focus first on improving technique, choose a weight that feels a bit challenging but one that you can control & try to perform the lift better each time.

once your technique is solid, start adding weight & pushing your sets harder. if technique breaksdown stop the set.

you don't have to use rir/rpe yet. 

-progression

# you want to add weight as often as posible.
# you want to have as good technique as posible.

best case scenario you improve both at the same time, but at some point if you keep adding weight technique may deteriorate, don't let it be too much, you allways want to keep good technique.

1) add 1-2kg if you can lift it with good tehcnique within the rep range. 2-5kg it's doable initially.

at first try to add weight every workout, over time progression will slow down, so weight jumps will be smaller & less frequent.

2) if you see that your techinque it's not so great (protip: record yourself), stop adding weight & focus on improving it. 

lifting with better technique & control is also progress.

3) don't modify your tempo & rest intervals to progress.

*if the rep range is 4-6, i would try to stay at 5 reps and add weight, if you get 4 reps it's no big deal, try to get 5 reps on all sets before adding more weight, that way you allways stay within te rep range.

on isolation use double progression - add reps, hit the top of the rep range on the first set, then add weight.

-rest intervals

3-4 min between compounds.
1-2 min between isolations.

-warm ups

do 2/4 ramping sets before each lift. more weight usually needs more warm up sets.

warm up sets should feel fairly easy.

check stage 0 e.g.

-finally

do not modify the parameters.  

train consistently, follow the program, eat well & in a 200-300kcal surplus,  sleep 8 hours & i guarantee you will progress a lot.

run this program for as long as you are progressing on it. 
if you are progressing fine i wouldn't change anything.
if progression slows down &/or you feel like you want to do more work you may move on to stage 2.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate', 'advanced']","['powerlifting', 'powerbuilding', 'muscle & sculpting', 'bodyweight fitness', 'olympic weightlifting', 'athletics', 'bodybuilding']",full gym,12.0,60.0,234,2025-02-05 01:11:00,2025-06-18 12:04:00,84.0

natty killer,"if nothing changes, then nothing changes. this program is designed around a high volume powerbuilding program. the premise of the program being if you're doing heavy weight, then the volume for reps will be low while the sets will be high, and if your training hypertrophy then then volume of reps will increase while sets stay low. i am not a specialist by any means. however, i like to think i understand myself and the average gym goer with similar goals enough to know how far we need to be pushed in order to make progress. this program is being designed by me to break my lifting plateaus.  i've been lifting for about 8 years naturally without following a program and have discovered that i am no longer making progress in my strength. i'm also not willing to eat like a fat ass to push more weights as i am already personally at the limit of what i consider healthy for my weight. with this program, i'm using what i considered to be the best hypertrophy and strength methods from the programs i've studied and use them to continue and build muscle while gaining strength. there are no deadlifts in this program. since this uses 4 days out of the week, if you value the deadlift, you can easily modify this program to fit it in there. for the pin press the goal after every 4 weeks is to either a) lower the safety pins by one notch with the same weight, or b) increase the weight used with the same rep range as starting week 1. the idea is to hopefully be able to perform the overload weight with the pin continuously getting lowered to full rom. the last few hypertrophy super sets are there for those who want to do additional arm hypertrophy workouts. i understand these workouts are longer than most (1.5-2 hour range), so if one needs to save time, they can pick and choose some of the non major compound movements depending on your goals. if you're trying to get stronger, i would not skip any of the bench/squat sets. for a hypertrophy focus, definitely do not skip the ending sets. this is a very high volume program. with that being said if you start this program and find your body is not use to the amount of volume prescribed, then it would be best to skip a strength day (pin press bench and squat day) and stick to the first three workouts.",['novice'],['bodybuilding'],full gym,8.0,90.0,239,2024-10-07 03:59:00,2025-06-18 11:26:00,84.0

new entry (upper _lower),"the purpose of this 12‑week upper/lower split workout program is to promote balanced hypertrophy and strength gains by dividing training sessions into dedicated upper‑body and lower‑body days, with a particular emphasis on maximizing lower‑limb development. by isolating muscle groups across four weekly workouts, the program allows for sufficient training volume and recovery, thereby optimizing the anabolic environment needed for muscle fiber growth. specifically, targeted exercise selection—such as heavy compound movements (e.g., back squats, romanian deadlifts) and complementary isolation work (e.g., leg extensions, seated calf raises)—combined with progressive overload protocols (e.g., incremental increases in load, volume, or time under tension) aims to stimulate the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves more effectively. in doing so, this program seeks not only to increase overall leg circumference and muscular definition but also to improve functional lower‑body strength and injury resistance, supporting both athletic performance and everyday movement quality.",['novice'],"['muscle & sculpting', 'bodybuilding']",full gym,12.0,80.0,408,2025-04-24 09:25:00,2025-06-18 09:25:00,112.0

nippard’s the bodybuilding transformation system,"perform a full general warm-up and exercise-specific warm-up every workout as
outlined below (should only take 5-10 mins max)

general warm-up:

perform the following general warm-up before every workout (5-10 mins max)
5-10 minutes	light cardio on machine on your choice of machine (treadmill,
		stairmaster, elliptical, bike, etc.)

10 reps per side	arm swings
15 reps per side	arm circles
10 reps per side	front-to-back leg swings
10 reps per side	side-to-side leg swings
10 reps per side	cable external rotation (optional)

exercise-specific warm-up
perform the following exercise-specific warm-up according to the number of warm-up sets listed in
the program

1 warm-up set listed	use ~60% of your planned working weight for ~6-10 reps (or until you feel warm and loose)

2 warm-up sets listed	perform a mini warm-up pyramid:
			warm-up set #1 = ~50% of planned working weight for ~6-10 reps
			warm-up set #2 = ~70% of planned working weight for 4-6 reps

3 warm-up sets listed	perform a full warm-up pyramid:
			warm-up set #1 = ~45% of planned working weight for ~6-10 reps
			warm-up set #2 = ~65% of planned working weight for 4-6 reps
			warm-up set #3 = ~85% of planned working weight for 3-4 reps



4 warm-up sets listed   perform a full warm-up pyramid:
			warm-up set #1 = ~45% of planned working weight for ~6-10 reps
			warm-up set #2 = ~60% of planned working weight for 4-6 reps
			warm-up set #3 = ~75% of planned working weight for 3-5 reps
			warm-up set #4 = ~85% of planned working weight for 2-4 reps

note that for the first week of the program, most sets are taken to an rpe of ~7-9.
this means you will be leaving 1-3 reps in the tank on most exercises. this only
lasts for the first week (to serve as a deload/intro week). after the first week, the
intensity will increase and you’ll start taking the last set of every exercise to failure.

all working sets are broken up into early sets and last sets. the early sets are all
the sets that come before your last set. usually the early sets should be a little bit
easier than the later sets (slightly lower rpe) whereas the last set is pushed to
failure on all exercises (besides intro/deload weeks). see the bodybuilding
transformation system guidebook for a full explanation of rpe.


each exercise has a clickable link which demonstrates how to perform the
exercise. (boostcamp user’s note: i tried to find fitting exercises from existing bank, sorry if there might be differences) i suggest watching each exercise demo before starting the workout.

all other aspects of the program, including when to make an exercise substitution
and how to progress through the rep ranges given is explained in the bodybuilding
transformation system guidebook. give it a full read before starting your first
workout! let's crush it!!

there is not core volume , neck nor forearms, you can do those if you feel like it or if you have time. i didnt put them simply because a workout would  take too long.
dont immediately set your tm at your 100% , or you will fail after the first week . put around 80% and each training max session see how you performed. each week your tm changes based on your repetition on the amrap set (this is for t1 only)
the progressions for the following week are based on how many reps you get:

if you get 0-1 reps, your tm stays the same

if you get 2-3 reps, your tm will increase by 5 lbs / 2.5 kg

if you get 4-5 reps, your tm will increase by 10 lbs / 5.0 kg

if you get more than 5 reps, your tm will increase by 15 lbs / 7.5 kg

this program is bursting at the seams like a pair of medium gym shorts in july. you’ll curl, you’ll extend, you’ll thrust with purpose, and by the end, your biceps will look like they’re smuggling pineapples, your triceps will resemble thankless meat batons, and your sleeves will be reduced to tight, trembling garters.

we’re not just training arms. we’re creating weapons of mass dysfunction.

the workout is split into three phases:

the warm-up stiffener – 5 minutes of “mobility” that looks suspiciously like foreplay at a wrestling-themed bachelorette party.

the vascular anaconda initiative – 20 minutes of biceps movements designed to put veins on your veins. by the end, your arms will look like they're choking themselves out in a hotel bathroom.

operation backblast – 20 minutes of triceps torture that turns your upper arms into aggressively patriotic turkey legs. every pressdown will feel like slamming the gates on a high-speed train of testosterone.

the ms-69 detonation protocol – a 15-minute non-stop, fart-filled superset finale where dignity dies, sleeves rip, and friendships are cemented in sweat, shame, and synchronized gastrointestinal distress.

this isn’t for beginners. this is for degenerates, meat wizards, brofessors of thrustology, and anyone brave enough to do zottman curls while holding in an unreleased chili dog demon. if you’re not flexing so hard you pass out in the parking lot, you’re the problem.

expect:

reps so dirty they’ll need to register as sex offenders in three states.

curls so intense you’ll start naming your veins.

triceps extensions that sound like balloon animals being made in a thunderstorm.

the occasional accidental protein fart that triggers gym-wide lockdown.

deep eye contact, deep thrusts, and deeper shame.

this program is best performed with:

your best bro (and future deportee),

a full scoop of illegal preworkout,

and zero concern for public opinion.

this is operation: full thrust™.
this is sgt. ms-69’s final salute.
this is how patriots pump.
and this… is your last chance to get veiny with your boy before he’s shipped off to give foreign soil a taste of grade-a american beef tendon.

grab the dumbbells.
brace for impact.
and remember: no rep left unstroked.

godspeed.

optimized phul (power hypertrophy upper lower),"the goal of these revisions is to make the phul program more beginner-friendly by slightly altering exercise selection and rearranging the lower body days to better support recovery and sustainability. with proper attention to diet and recovery, athletes of all levels should see noticeable gains in strength and hypertrophy.

deadlifts moved to the lower hypertrophy day to optimize recovery.

exercise order has been adjusted to accommodate this change, and calf volume has been slightly reduced.

front squats have been replaced with hack squats for a better quad stimulus with less overall fatigue and a more manageable movement pattern.

ab work has been added to each lower body day, which is optional but recommended for balanced core development.

for progression, aim to add either weight or reps each week. a simple method: once you hit the upper end of the rep range for a given exercise in all sets, increase the weight the next session. for squat and deadlift, add 10 lbs each time until you plateau, then reduce to 5 lbs increments. for bench press and ohp, aim to add 5 lbs each session. for accessory lifts, increase in the smallest possible increment.","['advanced', 'intermediate']","['powerlifting', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,12.0,90.0,312,2024-11-18 11:11:00,2025-06-29 06:04:00,126.0

oskars træningsprogram for verdens stærkeste kerne,"formålet er at du kan se dig selv blive stærkere i nogle grundlæggende bevægelser: bænkpres, rows, pulldowns, og squats. det er øvelser, der aktiverer flere muskelgrupper og kræver meget energi, så læg dit fokus på dem.

ud over de centrale øvelser kommer der nogle isolerede øvelser, der fokuserer på en enkelt muskelgruppe: skulder, biceps, triceps, og mave. de er vigtige at isolere, fordi de hjælper virkelig meget under de store øvelser. så vi træner ikke arme for at få gigantiske arme, men fordi de kan holde dig tilbage ved de vigtige øvelser, hvis de ikke er stærke nok.

det betyder sådan set bare at du mentalt skal lægge mere energi i nogle øvelser end andre. hvis du har travlt er det bedre at springe bicep curls over end at droppe squats. og hvis du kan mærke at du har en dag, hvor din energi er begrænset, skal du lægge mere i de store øvelser og presse dig selv mindre i de små. 

jeg har sat programmet til at vare i 14 uger. vi starter ud med nogle uger, hvor du laver mange gentagelser, og derfor lidt lavere vægt. så øger vi langsomt vægt og går ned i gentagelser. din opgave i den første uge er at finde den vægt, du kun kan løfte det antal gange, der er angivet ved hver øvelse. i løbet af ugerne vil vi gå mærkbart ned i gentagelser og mærkbart op i vægt. det skriver jeg i starten af ugen, så du ved hvad du skal gå efter. 

jeg har også sat tre deload-uger ind. her giver vi din krop lidt ro, men laver fortsat gentagelser, så træningen ikke bliver uvant. 

målet er at opnå muscle failure, altså komme frem til det sted, hvor du fysisk ikke kan udføre øvelsen mere. det er i de sidste gentagelser frem til det punkt, at du aktiverer dine muskler mest. 

vær opmærksom på om du mærker nogen smerter i knæ, hofter, skuldre, håndled, eller albuer. det er meningen at du skal gå op i vægt lige så langsomt, men man kan nemt komme lidt op at køre og gå for hurtigt op. bare mærk godt efter så går det fint. det er særligt ved squats at du skal være opmærksom for man kan nemt udføre øvelsen i dårlig form og komme til at overbelaste sig selv.","['intermediate', 'advanced']","['bodybuilding', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,14.0,90.0,224,2025-02-08 03:03:00,2025-06-18 08:37:00,147.0

phul power: strength meets size,"phul (power hypertrophy upper lower) is a comprehensive, 4-day training program designed to maximize both strength and muscle growth. combining the best of powerlifting and bodybuilding, phul hits all the key elements: heavy compound lifts to build raw strength and higher-rep accessory work for muscle size. whether you’re looking to add size to your frame or build serious strength, phul provides a balanced, proven structure to get you there.

key features:

	•	power and hypertrophy split: two days focused on heavy, strength-based training and two days dedicated to hypertrophy to build muscle mass.
	•	compound movements: big lifts like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and rows form the foundation of the program.
	•	customized for progression: progressive overload is at the core, with clear instructions to help you increase weight and reps week by week.
	•	upper-lower split: this structure allows you to train frequently and effectively, hitting every muscle group twice a week for maximum gains.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate']","['powerlifting', 'powerbuilding', 'bodybuilding', 'athletics']",full gym,16.0,70.0,368,2024-10-18 08:12:00,2025-06-18 12:11:00,130.66666666666666

pl1,"four-day powerlifting program with the aim of improving strength across 5 compound lifts:

squat
bench press
deadlift
overhead press
t-bar / barbell row

each week consists of 2 heavy lift days and 2 variation lift days:

day 1 - heavy squat, heavy bench
day 2 - heavy ohp, heavy deadlift, heavy t-bar
day 3 - variation squat, variation bench
day 4 - variation ohp, variation deadlift, variation row

each lift is further enhanced by additional lower intensity exercises for the relevant muscle groups on non-heavy and non-variation days. for example on days when you do not have heavy squat or variation squat, you will have hack squat or single leg press instead, in the 12 rep range.
this stimulates hypertrophic muscle growth and allows the development of technique, core strength and stability within similar ranges of movement, with a lower risk of injury.

while the variation exercises have been prescribed, you have the option to change these and select whichever variation you want - i simply had to choose something in order to complete the program. 

train with weights every other day, with a rest day or a  30-60 mins cardio session on alternate days, e.g.

mon - day 1
tues - rest
weds - day 2 
thurs - 30 mins cardio
fri - day 3 
sat - 40 mins cardio
sun - day 4 
mon - rest

note: if used in this way the program follows an 8-day rather than a weekly pattern. if a weekly pattern is important, this can be achieved most effectively by dropping the rest/cardio day between day 3 and day 4.

warm-up sets should be used prior to all heavy and variation exercises. 

accessory exercises can be swapped as necessary, e.g. bicep cable curl can be swapped with bicep dumbbell curl. i've tried to keep exercise selection low to maintain simplicity and consistency, but there might be practical reasons for using alternatives....or just to avoid boredom.","['intermediate', 'advanced']",['powerbuilding'],full gym,12.0,60.0,336,2024-09-02 10:24:00,2025-06-18 12:26:00,84.0

pitbull 5/3/1,"instructions. 

1. fill your 1 rm maxes with 90% of your 1rm. this number will move basically independently from your 1rm. it’s just a number.  

* acessories does not matter. don’t change the main lifts - ohp/deadlift/bench press/squat. other exercises feel free to change accordingly to your preferences and available equipment.

2. every 3 weeks, add weight to all lifts you made more than the minimum in the amraps. usually you want x for bench and ohp, and 2x for deadlift and squat, but it is not a rule. you can add 0,5 kg to bench and 1kg to deadlift and squats, and also   2,5kg to bench and 5kg to bench and squats. 
it’s better to be conservative, to avoid hitting a brick wall.

3. you can deload every 4th week or just keep going and deload when you feel like it. my suggestion is every 2 cycles. search for pitbull deload for the deload week.

4. don’t actually do “amraps”. leave one or two reps in the tank.

5. if you are on a good day, add joker sets, which is singles with 10% more weight than amraps","['intermediate', 'beginner', 'novice']",['bodybuilding'],garage gym,3.0,60.0,85,2025-02-20 03:17:00,2025-06-18 11:33:00,21.0

relieving tightness: stretching and mobilizing the hips, hamstrings, and other muscles that become stiff from extended sitting.

building functional strength: enhancing the body's ability to perform daily activities and prevent injuries by focusing on key muscle groups.

promoting mobility: restoring range of motion in joints and improving overall flexibility for better movement patterns.

establishing a fitness habit: creating a sustainable gym routine to support long-term health and wellness.

powerbuilding 4ever,"the plan is geared towards the following goals:
a) balanced combination of strength and hypertrophy training
b) simple and flexible
c) periodized and long-term executable

notes:
breaks: as short as possible for the main exercises, as long as necessary (should be in the range of 3 to 8 minutes as far as possible). for the rest, i would recommend deliberately reducing the breaks (usually 2-3 minutes).

cadences, intensity techniques, exercise variations, etc.: during the support exercises and on gk day - fire away! the only tip: it is more effective if you don't use it all the time. in addition, you should of course not exceed the specified load limit so as not to increase your overall fatigue too much.

fatigue management and individualization: the progression scheme and the number of sets and exercises are a good starting point. if you have gone through several cycles and have been attentive, you will notice where you can make adjustments: maybe in week 4 to 93% instead of 90%? maybe 4 sets of the support exercise instead of 3? maybe increase in waves instead of linearly? adjust it, but do yourself the favor of doing this after sound observation and analysis.

the 3 main exercises should only be swapped sparingly. it would be conceivable to do bench => overhead press (e.g. for strongman), deadlift => sumo deadlift or back squat => front squat from time to time.

""increase responsibly"" at the end of the cycle means that you should ask yourself whether you have just managed to cope with the load using a crippling technique - in which case it may be best to repeat it - or whether you have marched solidly through it - in which case you can increase accordingly.

if you fancy a bit of a thrill, you can of course add max attempts to the 4 or 5-week cycles. as a general rule, a maximum repetition will not kill you in terms of regeneration, but avoid grinders that are too hard, max tests that are too frequent and, above all, unsafe execution (lack of spotters, poor technique, etc.).

all other exercises can and should be responsibly changed. that means, for example, replacing the leg press with the belt squat, and not replacing the kh press with cable flys.

the plan is also suitable if you don't have much time for training. limit yourself to the absolute core: te1 squat+light bench, te2 lift+one back exercise, te3 bench+light squat - you can do it in 3*45min and still make progress. or even the extreme version in 2 days: te1 bend+bench, te2 lift+light bench (=2*45, can be completed on sat+sun, for example). scheme remains the same.

deloads, i.e. a 5th and light week in the cycle, by feel and not too often.

you can decide from week to week whether you do unit 4 - depending on your time, mood and recovery status. of course, you can also set priorities here.

please don't forget to warm up properly, stretch as needed and strengthen weak points (e.g. abdomen, rotators, lower back).",['intermediate'],['powerbuilding'],full gym,5.0,60.0,120,2024-09-01 03:55:00,2025-06-18 08:39:00,35.0

powerbuilding hybrid athlete (3 days p/w),"gym program designed for cyclists/runners/triathletes that want to gain muscle and strength, not just do injury prevention.

designed to have a *gym program* structure of something like:
mon: lower body
tues: upper body
wed: rest
thu: rest
fri: full body
sat: rest
sun: rest


this supports hybrid athlete splits, where you want to be more recovered for the later days in the week - for example doing long run / cycles on fridays and/or saturdays.

ideal days for *full* rest days (no exercise at all, or only very easy/recovery runs/cycles/swims) are thursdays and sundays. prioritise life on these days, keep a social life.

running or cycling interval training should ideally be done on the same day as the lower body session (with 6 hours+ between workouts) and/or wednesdays (allowing your lower body some rest on tuesday). do the form of exercise (i.e. the gym or cycle/run) that you want to improve the most at the moment as the first one on the monday if double stacking. same goes for if you’re doing a long run/cycle on friday with the full body session.

progress the weights linearly week on week. bench add 1.25-2.5kg, deadlift/squats add 1.25-5kg - all depending on how you’re feeling and your experience level.

every 4th week is a deload week and this is when you should do any ftp testing / 5k tt runs / races. the week following a deload week should be starting from your week 2 weights if you’re more experienced, or week 3 if you’re less experienced and have a higher ceiling to reach before any strength plateau.

if ever you are struggling with recovery, prioritise the workout on that day that you want to be improving most in as a priority (e.g. if your priority is running, then do that first in the day, then make that weights workout a deload. or if your priority is the gym, then do that workout first then turn the run on that day into a z1-z2 easy/recovery effort). listen to your body.

eat lots of food, and ensure carbs to fuel especially double stacking. 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight you have.

a microcycle could last from 7 to 12 days, so it is possible to train two times per week.
rest days between sessions are mandatory: at least one (24 hours).
cluster the 8+ reps sets if/when necessary but don't increase the weight until you can complete the prescribed reps in a straight set! i wouldn't recommend clusters for the pullover.

progression: provided you stay in the reps range prescribed, you can progress anyway you prefer: add weight (linear, one step forward, two back etc etc.); reps in the fashion you decide (double progression, dynamic double progression and the like). if you stale, change the way (example: pass from double progression to linear et similia).

as you can see, intensity microcycles (with series of singles/triplets) are alternated with volume ones, changing the main movements. that should prevent the necessity of deloads.
in case you want to deload, just cut out the isolation movements or 1/2 of the strip sets.","['novice', 'intermediate']",['bodybuilding'],garage gym,6.0,60.0,96,2024-04-01 04:59:00,2025-06-18 09:34:00,42.0

prometheus protocol,"with the prometheus protocol, we have undoubtedly subscribed to the “less is more” philosophy.

except when it comes to eating; where more is certainly more. 🙂

here is what you will need for the prometheus protocol:

1.       two relatively heavy kettlebells

2.       2 days a week to dedicate to training

3.       stock options in chipotle

the prometheus protocol may very well be the simplest program you will ever follow, as it requires you to train only 2 days a week. need i remind you however that simple rarely equals easy?

when it comes to putting on size our goal is to elicit a maximal hormonal response (particularly growth hormone, testosterone, and igf-1).

we will utilize two of the biggest compound kettlebell movements for this:

1.       the double kettlebell front squat

2.       the double kettlebell clean and press

between these two movements, just about every single muscle group in your body will be taxed. both of these exercises are exceptionally high in neuromuscular activation, and when loaded with an appropriate amount of weight, will indeed elicit quite a remarkable hormonal response.

the program itself as i mentioned earlier only has you training two days a week. do not train on consecutive days of the week! please allow for at least two days of rest in between each training session.

i do not care whether you perform your sets of front squats or double clean and press first, only that you complete the prescribed amount of sets and reps which are as follows:

double clean and press – 10 sets x 5 reps @ 60-80% of your 1 rep max
double kettlebell front squat – 10 sets of 5 reps @ 60-80% of your 1 rep max

it’s no mystery that you need to move heavy weight around to put on size. but in order to achieve the best response for muscle hypertrophy we must use a tactical mix of volume, density, and intensity.

here are the rules:

1. rest periods between sets should be between 60-120 seconds

2. use a weight that is between 60-80% of your one rep max. it goes without saying (except for the fact that i’m saying it…) that you should use the heaviest weight you possibly can so long as you are still able to hit the required of reps and keep your rest periods under 120 seconds.

3. if done correctly, each training session should take no longer than 30-40 minutes.",['intermediate'],"['powerbuilding', 'athletics']",garage gym,4.0,30.0,16,2024-04-08 02:45:00,2025-06-23 12:13:00,14.0
psychotically strong,"the psychotically strong program follows the periodization strategy of the alex bromley’s 70s powerlifter but swaps traditional barbell movements for a brutal mix of calisthenics, sandbag work, and ring training. this program builds raw, functional strength while emphasizing upper-body dominance and grip endurance.

each training day includes foundational movement patterns like dips, ring push-ups, pull-ups, and curls, ensuring balanced muscular development. sandbag clean & presses, squats, lunges, and shoulder tosses provide unrelenting full-body tension and stability under load. dedicated chest and arm work is incorporated for hypertrophy, ensuring both size and strength gains.

saitama s1 - ul hypertrophy,"stage 1

if you are new to the gym this is your program. 
but if you have no sports/training experience at all you may want to check stage 0.

1) consistency is king - it is the most important thing & the fastest way to your goals.

2) technique - learn how to preform the lifts correctly.

3) intensity - learn how to train hard.

-exercise selection 

learn fundamental movement patterns (squat, hinge, push, pull) performing basic compound lifts & mastering technique on them as much as possible, isolation is not neglected.

i recommend that you start with the barbell basics such as bb squat, rdl, bb bench, pull ups & oh bb press if you can do them with a reasonable range of motion. if you can't, try an easier variation.

check stage 0 for recommended variations.

choose one lift for each movement pattern and stick to it.

-intensity

you shouldn't go to failure as a novice.

focus first on improving technique, choose a weight that feels a bit challenging but one that you can control & try to perform the lift better each time.

once your technique is solid, start adding weight & pushing your sets harder. if technique breaksdown stop the set.

you don't have to use rir/rpe yet. 

-progression

# you want to add weight as often as posible.
# you want to have as good technique as posible.

best case scenario you improve both at the same time, but at some point if you keep adding weight technique may deteriorate, don't let it be too much, you allways want to keep good technique.

1) add 1-2kg if you can lift it with good tehcnique within the rep range. 2-5kg it's doable initially.

at first try to add weight every workout, over time progression will slow down, so weight jumps will be smaller & less frequent.

2) if you see that your techinque it's not so great (protip: record yourself), stop adding weight & focus on improving it. 

lifting with better technique & control is also progress.

3) don't modify your tempo & rest intervals to progress.

*if the rep range is 4-6, i would try to stay at 5 reps and add weight, if you get 4 reps it's no big deal, try to get 5 reps on all sets before adding more weight, that way you allways stay within te rep range.

on isolation use double progression - add reps, hit the top of the rep range on the first set, then add weight.

train consistently, follow the program, eat well & in a 200-300kcal surplus, sleep 8 hours & i guarantee you will progress a lot. if you stagnate, make sure that you have this dialed in before making any changes.

-rest intervals

3-4 min between compounds.
1-2 min between isolations.

-warm ups

do 2/4 ramping sets before each lift. more weight usually needs more warm up sets.

warm up sets should feel fairly easy.

check stage 0 e.g.

-finally

do not modify the parameters.  

run this program for as long as you are progressing on it. 
if you are progressing fine don't change anything.

how to find starting weight for workout?

for your first week, start with light weights as warm-ups to gauge what weights to use on your working sets. your goal is rpe 8-9 per set, which means finding a weight that you can do for 1-2 reps shy of failure in the target rep range. it is better to be conservative with the weight and focus on good form before adding weight. do not ego lift.

when to add weight for workout?

every workout, aim to add either weights or reps for every set as long as you are training at rpe 8-9. over time, you'll find that you can keep gaining strength at the same rpe. again, avoid going to failure on sets.

how much weight to add per month?

let’s break it down—pound isn’t just a verb here. it’s a lifestyle.
you’ll pound iron like a monarch mid-battle rage, hurling plates with violent purpose, letting the gym echo with the sound of your rule. you’ll pound reps down your throat, non-stop, till you’re gagging on gains and choking on your own ambition. and yes—squat day hits different. you’ll be bent over the throne of pain, consensually humbled by cold, unyielding stee, humbled and wide-eyed, and receive the kind of deep tissue punishment that leaves your soul sore and your crown slightly crooked.

because in this court, the bar doesn’t ask—it takes.
you will squat. you will get buried. you will rise sore, broken, and reborn.

every week, the house of slab demands tribute. you’ll train back with deadlifts to snap your spine into loyalty, shoulders & arms to arm the rebellion, and then the cycle of meat dominance begins. odd weeks, chest reigns supreme, pounded twice into a swollen monument of power. even weeks, legs stage a violent coup, and the glutes get pounded so deep you’ll reconsider your life choices every time you try to sit, stand, or exist.

this isn’t fitness. it’s slab warfare. it’s a royal pounding, a coronation of chaos and a glorious uprising of meat and madness, where you either wear the crown… or feel its weight from below.

to best understand sheiko’s training methodology, lift vault highly recommends you read or listen to his interview with omar isuf.
sheiko programs are powerlifting programs attributed to boris sheiko, renowned russian powerlifting coach. his programs are known for their high volume and great results for those who can complete them. more of a loose working template than a strict program, many different variations of sheiko powerlifting programs have been circulating internet forums for years. it is recommended you determine your skill level with a lifter classification chart to pick the right program.",['intermediate'],['powerlifting'],garage gym,12.0,80.0,157,2025-01-21 11:25:00,2025-06-26 11:37:00,112.0

simply savage v0.3,"this program is my first and i wanted to share it. thanks for taking the time to look it over.

program goals (in order of consideration):
1) easy to follow with simple progression and exercises.
2) a focus on longevity with no compromising exercises and functionality choices.
3) to increase muscle mass.
4) modularity to allow for more work or improve our body. 
5) to increase strength and explosiveness.

this program can be done by a novice up to a more advanced lifter. i do not recommend this program for beginners. it is recommended you have some lifting experience. it is also recommended you do not do this during a cut or losing weight.


how does this program operate?

scheduling - 5 lifting days, 2 rest days. 3 “power” days, 2 “hypertrophy” days. after 3 power days, we rest, after 2 hypertrophy days, we rest. the split follows a pull-push-legs upper/lower routine.

example routine would look something like this:

sunday: off
monday: pull power
tuesday: push power
wednesday: legs power
thursday: off
friday: upper hypertrophy
saturday: lower hypertrophy

power and hypertrophy days just denotes the rep ranges and intensity we will do. for rest days, we should stay active but no lifting or high intensity exercise. 

progression -
each week is a different goal. week 1 we set our baseline to measure progression, week 2 we increase our sets, week 3 we increase reps, week 4 we max out, week 5 we deload.

please try and follow the guidelines in the workout. it is not perfect but if followed, you should see progression in both muscle and strength. 

main lifts in the program are the ones we are trying to progress in. secondary lifts are just accessory work. for our main lifts there will be a “top set” where we will work harder than the others. rpe is the same as rir (reps in reserve) for this program. so an rpe 8 means you leave 2 reps in reserve as far as fatigue goes. 

sets without an rpe indication are considered warmup sets.

modularity - 

you will notice each day has some additional work that can be done. 

the purpose of this is to allow the freedom to make days harder should you be up for it. there is also the option to do functional work to improve our body. it is all completely optional, however functional work is recommended.

extra stuff:

inspiration - 
i draw a majority of my training philosophies from john meadows. he was the first online persona i followed and got me hooked. other guys i learned from are jeff nippard, joe defranco, and my old trainer john furia. other than that just playing sports and being the gym the past 10 years. 

warmup routines - 

upper body - joe defranco simple six
lower body - joe defranco limber eleven

size & strength for the average busy trainee,"this program is designed por busy people who can only train up to a couple days a week, or lazy people who want to gain muscle and get stronger. note: you can also perform more days, in blocks 1&2, just make sure they don't stress your joints and that all the extra work being done is just hyperthrophy, at the intensity of each week.

exercise selection may vary during the weeks, you can switch the accesory work, as long as they target the same muscles. however i don't recommend changing them very often.

the program can be divided into three different training blocks:

block 1: acummulation phase, we will focus on hyperthrophy at the beggining, so that the muscle gains come when we are training for strength (more muscle lifts more weight). we still practice the big three, but we don't aim for increasing load just yet. during this block intesity remains moderate, generally rpe 7, so don't take sets to failure. total volume is increased from week to week, adding a set to most exercises.

block 2: intensification phase: volume is maintained while increasing intensity. rep reanges lower and sets are mainteined. add 2,5 kg or 5 lb to your sbd during this block. again try to stay fixed to the rpe given.

block 3: realisation phase: intensity keeps increasing, this time at the expense of volume, reps and sets decrease week to week. with this in mind, every week add 5 kg or 10 lb to your main lifts, the last week you can (should, i mean, is the main purpose of the program :d).  

please, don't be stupid, if you feel extremely tired from session to session or feel any articular discomfort take a deload or a week off. i haven't included deloads because i assuming begginers and intermidiates don't lift 200kgs.
also, perform the exercises with good technique and respect the rpes if you don't know what rpe means how dificult was the set in a scale from 1 to 10.
rpe 7: 3 reps in reserve (rir)

rpe 7.5: 2 rir, could have increased a bit the load

rpe 8: 2 rir

smash & pump 4-day ul,"smash & pump 4-day upper/lower is one part conjugate and one part hit.  this will be a good option for most people, providing a relatively equal focus on strength and hypertrophy.

unlike most of what you'll find on boostcamp, smash & pump is not a program.  rather, it's a template that allows you to select all of your own exercises.  you'll find that all of the exercises listed initially are placeholders, to be replaced by you.  

there's a relatively detailed document that provides background information on the template, and gives general guidance on what exercises are and are not appropriate for each slot.  

given the nature of this template, a sound understanding of the basics of programming, and experience performing many different types of exercises will definitely be helpful.  this is likely not a good starting point for someone that's newer to lifting.

the program looks simple but it isn’t easy in the slightest. there will be 4 squatting sessions per week and each week will require you to add 5-10 lbs on the bar. it will be brutal so some guidelines for the program
1. make sure to eat at maintenance or above. 
2.prioritize recovery and mobility work to reduce soreness. 
3. do not do any heavy lower body work besides the squat. 
4.your body can only handle so much fatigue, be smart with how structure your lower body accessories, keep upper body training at maintenance. 
5.if you fail a set or if the reps are extremely difficult to complete, keep the weight the same for next week.
6.use a belt or go beltless for the working sets.
7. rest accordingly in between sets 
8.highly recommended to do some liss cardio on rest days to reduce soreness and help with recovery.

smolov rework,"the infamous smolov program has 2 primary downsides.
1. it's hyperfocused on a single lift, your cannot effectively build your, bench, squat and deadlift on it.
2. it's completely unsustainable, within 4-8 weeks overuse injuries are bound too happen because of the sheer amount of volume in a training week. 

so what happens when you make some adjustments for both, spread out the volume over multiple weeks and still include some useful assistance movements. 

this is the goal of practical smolov, but in all honesty this is an experiment and should be undertaken with caution.

now this is not something you would jump into directly following an peak to a 1rm, this would be after a lighter volumizing phase to prep for this more hypertrophy focused protocol.

sololeveling,"this program is the culmination of years of my personal experience in working out, as well as insights gathered from fitness influencers and knowledgeable individuals in the fitness community. it’s not just a workout plan but a reflection of what has worked for me personally. some exercises in this program are my favorites because they have delivered great results or simply felt good to perform.

the foundation of this program is a basic double progression method. in simple terms, you’ll work within a set and rep range, and once you hit the top of that range for all sets, you’ll increase the weight. for instance, if you have 3 sets of 5-8 reps (3x5-8), you’ll gradually add reps each week until you reach 3x8 with the current weight. after that, you’ll increase the weight and start over at the lower end of the range. it’s straightforward—so don’t overthink it!

for optimal recovery, rest between sets should be 90 to 150 seconds, with 2 minutes being ideal if you’re unsure.

methods explained:
cluster sets - small sets inside a regular set. these small sets are known as sub-sets. short rests are added between every sub-set. this allows your muscles to recover, and you can train with heavier weights with less fatigue. for example 5 minutes of exercise with 10-15 seconds break between 5 reps

super set - doing two exercises in a succession without rest (preferably these 2 exercises should work different muscle / be complementary groups so you can train one while resting the other one)

squat method
use periodization (5-week blocks)
structure:
week 1: start light (e.g., 140 kg for top set of 3).
weeks 2-5: add 5-10 kg weekly (e.g., 145, 150, 155, 160 kg).
peak: week 5 is your strongest. if performance drops in weeks 6-7, your peak is week 5.
next block:
start slightly heavier than the previous block (e.g., 145 kg in block 2).
repeat 5-week cycles, aiming to end heavier each block.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate']","['bodybuilding', 'powerbuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",full gym,12.0,70.0,385,2025-01-14 08:45:00,2025-06-18 08:17:00,98.0

speedrun to intermediate,"contrary to the name, this program isn’t the fastest route possible to becoming an intermediate lifter, it’s about building a solid foundation and creating good habits with a range of basic exercises with clear linear progression.

this program is focused on building size in all areas as well as general strength with a focus on the main 4 exercises: squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press.

the first 4 week phase has a slight emphasis on hypertrophy through the use of higher rep ranges and more isolation exercises. the second 4 week phase has more emphasis on strength through the use of lower rep ranges with a higher intensity and more compound movements. the final week gives you the opportunity to set a 1-3rm on the 4 main exercises.

this program is designed to be re-run after completion for as long as possible until progression stops from which you can graduate onto a more complex and periodized program, or use your knowledge acquired to create your own progression. this program is suitable for beginners, novices and early intermediates and is designed for consistent, simple progression with enough variation to minimize overuse and early plateaus.

to progress on the assistance and isolation exercises, simply follow a basic double progression where you would use a weight to hit the prescribed rep range and once you hit the top of the rep range, increase the weight and work back up.","['novice', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced']",['bodybuilding'],full gym,8.0,60.0,200,2024-04-26 02:04:00,2025-06-18 12:24:00,56.0

starter powerlifting minimalist program,"build up your squat, bench, and deadlift strength with this 3 day full body beginner to novice powerlifting program.

workout weekly schedule:
day 1 squat/bench
day 2 rest
day 3 deadlift/ohp
day 4 rest
day 5 squat/bench
day 6 rest
day 7 rest

consistency:
stay consistent, try not to skip workouts.

how to progress:
on the main lifts add 5-10lbs every week, and on the accessory movement either add reps or weight through the weeks.
for example:
on a 5x5
week 1 bench press 5x5 135lb
week 2 bench press 5x5 140lb 
week 3 bench press 5x5 145lb
week 4 bench press 5x5 150lb
week 5 bench press 5x5 155lb

rest:
rest between 3-5 minutes on the main lifts, and 2-4 on the extra lifts.

diet:
eat a high protein, and high to moderate calories for maximum strength and size gain.

sleep:
sleep between 7-9 hours of sleep a night for physical and mental health.

exercise form:
preform each exercise with the right form, slow eccentric, strong tight steady motion, focusing on the stretched position.

effort:
you need to put in some effort in training to see good results. both effort in how to train, being consistent, and preforming high intensity training in the exercises. try to stick with the rpe in the program, but if you know what you are doing you can go closer to failer or even farther if you know it's too much. but most people are farther from failure then they think. so just train hard and stick to it the best you can.
what is rpe?
rpe/rate of perceived exhaustion is a scale of how close you are to failing a lift.
[rpe 1] you can do 9 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 2] you can do 8 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 3] you can do 7 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 4] you can do 6 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 5] you can do 5 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 6] you can do 4 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 7] you can do 3 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 8] you can do 2 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 9] you can do 1 more reps until you can't 
[rpe 10] you can't do any more reps no matter what



important keys to maximum strength and size:
1. consistency
2. progression
3. rest
3. diet
4. sleep
5. exercise form
6. effort

this program is made by emil krastev, ipf powerlifter and coach, founder of strength squad. i have only modified it to add 4th day, focusing on deadlift accessories to build up strength in the upper/lower back, glutes and legs. feel free to modify the 4th day to make up for whatever weaknesses you might have - for example, you can add overhead pressing and more shoulder/bench press movements, entirely up to you!	
				
have in mind that this is a generalized approach, meaning that it's not targeting any individual athlete strengths or weaknesses or problem-solving strategies.

super squats,"the super squats program, forged in the 1930s by joseph curtis hise and popularized by peary rader’s iron man magazine, defies modern fitness complexity with a singular promise: 30 pounds of muscle in 6 weeks. built on three pillars—squats, milk, and rest—it transforms even “hard gainers” through relentless effort and old-school discipline.  

one gut-wrenching set with a weight meant for 10 reps. lifters take deep breaths between reps to stretch the rib cage and flood muscles with oxygen.  

add 5–10 lbs weekly, pushing limits despite trembling legs and nausea.  

4,000–5,000 calories/day, emphasizing whole milk (2+ quarts), meat, eggs, and calorie-dense meals.  

8+ hours of sleep and minimal activity between workouts (2–3x/week).  


why it works:
20-rep squats shock the entire body, spiking hormones like testosterone and growth hormone.  

forced breathing widens the torso, creating a larger foundation for muscle growth.  

the extreme stress triggers nutrient partitioning toward muscle repair.  


in an era of gadget-driven workouts, super squats is a rallying cry for simplicity. no machines, supplements, or gimmicks—just barbells, milk, and grit. as peary rader declared, “the squat is the greatest single exercise known to man.” for lifters seeking rapid gains and timeless lessons in perseverance, this program remains the ironclad standard.","['intermediate', 'advanced', 'novice']","['bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting', 'bodyweight fitness']",garage gym,6.0,80.0,78,2025-05-18 08:49:00,2025-06-18 09:18:00,56.0

like the original program, start lighter with smaller increases in weight so the 6 weeks is sustainable. goals will vary based on recovery and strength. examples can be a 5lb increase every week for each exercise, 5lb increase 2x a week, 5lb increase every workout, or a mix of all three. no matter what there should always be an increase somewhere. remember, the goal of this program is not necessarily pushing prs, it’s to allow your body to rest and recover and avoid serious fatigue, allowing you to get ready to complete another cycle of the 20 rep super squats.","['intermediate', 'advanced']",['powerbuilding'],at home,6.0,60.0,126,2024-04-29 09:19:00,2025-06-18 09:16:00,42.0

suraj's upper-lower functional strength,"upper-lower powerbuilding program: purpose & overview
the upper-lower powerbuilding program is designed to bridge the gap between strength training and muscle hypertrophy, combining powerlifting principles with bodybuilding techniques. this structured approach allows lifters to develop maximal strength while also focusing on muscular size and aesthetics.

purpose of the program
the primary goal of the upper-lower powerbuilding program is to:

increase strength – by incorporating progressive overload on key compound movements such as the squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press, the program helps lifters build raw strength.
build muscle mass – using bodybuilding-style accessory work, the program ensures well-rounded hypertrophy, leading to a balanced and muscular physique.
enhance recovery and performance – with an alternating upper-lower split, muscles receive adequate recovery time while still being trained frequently enough for optimal growth.
improve athleticism – by incorporating explosive and functional strength work, lifters develop power that translates into sports performance and general athletic ability.
program structure
the program follows an upper-lower split, meaning workouts alternate between upper-body and lower-body sessions. each workout includes a mix of strength-focused lifts, hypertrophy accessory movements, and sometimes explosive work to enhance power output.

for bench increase 5 pounds every week
for squat and deadlift increase 10 pounds per week

example weekly layout:
day 1 – upper body strength (bench press focus)
day 2 – lower body strength (squat/deadlift focus)
day 3 – rest or active recovery
day 4 – upper body hypertrophy (bodybuilding emphasis)
day 5 – lower body hypertrophy (bodybuilding emphasis)
day 6 – optional extra work/conditioning
day 7 – rest
who is this program for?
intermediate to advanced lifters looking to gain strength while maintaining an aesthetic physique.
powerlifters who want to incorporate more hypertrophy work to fill out their weight class and improve weak points.
bodybuilders who want to incorporate heavier compound lifts for more density and strength.
athletes who need strength and size without sacrificing functionality and movement efficiency.
training methodology
primary lifts: heavy, low-rep work (3-6 reps) on compound movements to drive strength gains.

progression:
for (w) the progression is as follow: listen to your body, i would recommend to not add kg every workout, but to reach the max rep goal for every set. you could also add kg for the first set (let it be the top set), and add reps on the rest, and so on, but always try to get the max reps prescribed, do not lower the reps.

the compound code 📈,"the compound code is a 4-week strength and hypertrophy program rooted in old-school barbell training — big lifts, smart progressions, and no fluff. designed for intermediate lifters, this program fuses principles from 5/3/1 and gzcl into a high-intensity block that delivers results in size, strength, and mental grit.
each week follows a calculated structure of heavy compounds, explosive volume work, and focused accessories — all centred around time-tested barbell movements. whether you're trying to bust through a plateau or just get brutally strong and big, the compound code gives you the blueprint.

what to expect:
• 4-week block: progressively overloaded intensity with room to repeat or build upon
• core lifts: squat, deadlift, bench, and overhead press — treated like a religion
• structure: tiered approach (like gzcl) with wave loading (inspired by 5/3/1)
• accessory work: purposeful, targeted, and progression-friendly
• focus: strength, hypertrophy, and work capacity

best for:
• intermediate lifters who know their way around a barbell
• lifters who want results without fluff or gimmicks
• fans of programs like 5/3/1, gzcl, and classic strength training

the compound code isn’t trendy — it’s timeless.

progression:

if you get all reps with quality in week 3, increase your training max with 5 kg or 10 lbs for lower body lifts and 2.5 kg or 5 lbs for upper body lifts after week 4 (deload week).


warm up every workout with:

1: first do 5 minute easy cardio of any kind.
2: then do “agile 8 2.0” below;

 • feet/ankle - rolling bottom of feet with lacrosse ball (60s per foot)
• ankle - weighted calf stretch or knees over toes lunge (depends on what gives you a better stretch)
• glutes - lacrosse ball (60s per side)
• adductors - adductor smash or foam rolling or cosack squats or rocking frog stretch
• hip flexor/quads - hip flexor stretch
• thoracic extension/rotation - banded thoracic rotation
• pecs - lacrosse ball across pec or pec opener using rack
• lats/shoulders - relaxed hang from chinup bar (60s-120s total).


core/abs:

i recommend doing 5-15 minutes of core/abs work after you day 2 strength work. this is entirely up to you. but i recommend either ab wheel, any kind of carries, or just follow a youtube ab/core stability workout like i do, with focus on different kind of planks.


cardio/conditioning:

i recommend 10-30 minutes of intervals after your day 1 strength work, i like the norwegian 4x4 intervals on the bike. do 4 minutes max effort, then 3 minutes easy recovery, for 4 rounds.

then i recommend 60 minutes of liss at around 60-70% of maximum heart rate, or if you don’t have heart rate monitor you should be able to breathe through your nose the entire time. do this 60 minutes on 3 of your “off days”.


rest/off day:

the best damn strength plan for natural lifters,"but what about maximal strength? that’s what this plan is all about (size being the second objective). we’ll dive into the details in just a bit, but first, let’s recap a few essentials.

what all natural lifters should know
if you’re a natural lifter you’ve probably tried many advanced training programs and noticed that pretty much nothing came out of it. here are a few reasons why that may have happened:

1. the main enemy of natural lifters is excessive cortisol.
this is especially true if it’s chronically elevated. cortisol can greatly limit muscle growth by increasing protein/muscle breakdown and decreasing protein synthesis. it can also slow growth by increasing myostatin activation.

myostatin is the gene that limits how much muscle you can build. the more activated it is, the less muscle your body will allow you to carry. this means, excess cortisol limits your muscle growth potential.

2. training volume is what triggers cortisol release the most.
cortisol’s main function during physical activity is the mobilization of stored energy to fuel the session. the more fuel you need, the more cortisol you’ll release. and of course you’ll need more fuel when volume is higher. the moral of the story? natural lifters can’t do as much volume as enhanced lifters and expect to grow optimally.

3. natural lifters can’t artificially increase protein synthesis.
they don’t have the benefit of anabolic drugs, so their bodies rely almost exclusively on the training session (and nutrition) to trigger protein synthesis. under normal circumstances, protein synthesis is elevated in a trained muscle for up to 24 hours after a workout. but after that, it comes back down to normal levels.

if a natural lifter trains a muscle only once per week, muscle growth will be fairly slow because the period where protein synthesis is significantly elevated in a muscle is short. a natural lifter will get more muscle growth training a muscle twice per week and even more if he or she can hit a muscle three times in the week.

4. volume and frequency are inversely related.
the more frequently you train, the less volume you should do at each workout… that is, if you want to build muscle or strength. so the basic principles for natural lifters are:

train each muscle frequently, ideally 3 times per week to trigger protein synthesis more often.
keep volume low to allow for the greater frequency.
since the number of work sets will be low, push them extremely hard.

the big plates method,"this is a super simple and minimalistic strength focused program inspired by dan john that consists of 2 or 3 exercises per day, utilizes double progression, and only uses big plates - 45’s, 25’s (and maybe 10’s). 

it’s a 4-day program that consists of ‘heavy’, ‘light’, and ‘accessory’ lifts for squat, bench, and deadlift. 

there’s nothing fancy here. big results require big effort on big lifts, and this program focuses on the bare essentials for building strength.

progression:
here are the default rep ranges:
heavy = 3-5 reps
light = 6-8 reps
accessory = 7-10 reps

when you reach the top end of the rep range for all 3 sets you should move up to the next weight increment and start back at the low end of the rep range. you may need to repeat the same reps for more than 1 week and there’s no problem with this. if you repeat for three consecutive weeks and are unable to increase the number of reps completed, change to a different exercise. 

program notes:
- there is no set structure for which days of the week you should lift on, but it’s recommended to not lift more than 2 consecutive days. 
- progression is designed around using only ‘big plates’.  squat and deadlift should only use 45 and 25 pound plates (or the corresponding kg plates). bench can also use 10 pound plates, otherwise the rep range will need to be significantly widened to allow progression. 
- the rep ranges can be modified as needed. example: you may find that if you complete 5 reps on the heavy squat day and increase weight by 25 pounds next time that you’re unable to do the 3 rep minimum with this new weight. in this case you can and should change the high end of your rep range to 6 or 7. this can be very individual. 
- this program is designed to optimize for time. if you have extra time on a given day, feel free to add in some isolation work, ab work, calf work, conditioning work, etc.
- the exercises were all selected with the assumption that only a barbell, rack, bench, and weight plates are available. if you have access to machines, functional trainer, dumbbells, bands, etc. feel free to make use of them.
- the program is setup for 8 weeks, but can and should be run as long as you are making progress and enjoying it.","['beginner', 'novice']","['bodybuilding', 'muscle & sculpting', 'athletics']",garage gym,8.0,30.0,80,2024-01-06 01:48:00,2025-06-18 08:51:00,28.0

read before starting

perform a full general warm-up and exercise-specific warm-up every workout as
outlined below (should only take 5-10 mins max)


note that for the first week of the program, most sets are taken to an rpe of ~7-9.
this means you will be leaving 1-3 reps in the tank on most exercises. this only
lasts for the first week (to serve as a deload/intro week). after the first week, the
intensity will increase and you’ll start taking the last set of every exercise to failure.


all working sets are broken up into early sets and last sets. the early sets are all
the sets that come before your last set. usually the early sets should be a little bit
easier than the later sets (slightly lower rpe) whereas the last set is pushed to
failure on all exercises (besides intro/deload weeks). see the bodybuilding

goals:
look big as fast as possible, even with your clothes on.

transition from beginner well into the intermediate levels by learning how to train to failure and beyond failure, boost work capacity, embrace variety, and incorporate isolation exercises focused on the 'show' muscles: neck, traps, delts, upper pecs, arms, and lats.

how to:
supersets are suggestions, just like grips and handles; adapt according to your gym and circumstances.

count 1 minute of rest between supersets; the workout should take 1 to 1.5 hours maximum.

i don’t specify rpe because you're meant to go to failure or 1-2 reps in reserve with all exercises. listen to your body.

blank sets are rest-pause follow-ups (i didn’t find a better way to show this on the app).

weekly volume:
full body 3x a week.
sets per week:

arms: 20
traps: 17
delts: 13
pecs: 12
lats: 11
posterior chain: 10
neck: 9
quads: 8
abs: 7

use a good old double progression system: master the weights and increase reps until heavy days start to feel like medium, and medium morph into light. that's your signal to increase the weights and return to the suggested rep scheme. if needed, add sets and/or days as you progress on your hypertrophic journey, tweaking the heavy-medium-light framework.

next level:
provided you have the recovery capacity and joint health for it...

the original schedule:
heavy-rest-medium-rest-light-rest-rest

could become:
heavy-lower-light-rest-medium-arms-light-rest

**progressive overload guidelines**

progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress on your muscles to keep them adapting and growing. this program uses several progressive overload strategies:

- increase reps: when you hit the top of your rep range with good form, add 1–2 reps per set.
- increase weight: once you can complete all sets at the upper rep range for two consecutive sessions (the ""2-for-2 rule""), increase your dumbbell weight by 2.5–5 lbs (or 5–10%).
- increase sets: if you’re limited by available weights, add a set (up to 4 per exercise) for more volume.
- adjust tempo: slow down the lowering (eccentric) phase or add pauses to increase difficulty.
- reduce rest: shorten rest periods to increase intensity when appropriate.
- change variation: every 12–16 weeks, swap in similar exercises (e.g., split squats for lunges) to keep things fresh.

*progression is gradual—never rush increases. listen to your body and prioritize form over load to avoid injury and burnout.*

---
**sample yearly progression**

weeks 1–4: learn form, start at lower weight
weeks 5–12: gradually increase reps/weight
weeks 13–24: add sets or swap in new exercise variations
weeks 25–36: focus on slow tempo, pause reps, introduce rpe 8–9 sets for advanced
weeks 37–48: increase intensity, try supersets or circuits
weeks 49–52: deload (reduce volume), retest maxes, celebrate progress

the kushymonster,"*recommended for intermediate lifters or above because of intensity techniques, but beginners are welcome to try.

this program is hypertrophy focused, built to target every major muscle group in your body for comprehensive muscle development and strength gains. as someone who’s tried a plethora of influencer-created programs, and tested my own, i’ve picked and chosen my favourite tips and tricks to put into this program. we’ll use intensity techniques, we’ll train to failure, and we’ll select exercises that maximise our focus on muscle stimulation (taking issues like stability, injury, etc. out of the equation).

we’ll train 3 on, 1 off. sarms, legs & abs, chest & back, rest. repeat.

always control the eccentric, pause at the stretch, and explode up (safely). there’s no set tempo, but each rep should last at least 2 seconds.

rest at least 90 seconds between all sets. some will require more rest, and that’s okay.

i hate to use the word “optimal,” but this program is built to be optimal. we’ll run a 6-day, 10 week program, with a deload week after every 4 weeks (weeks 5 and 10). exercise selection will be based on mine and my clients’ personal experience—how much you can feel the target muscle, how well you recover, and how much strength you can gain. from personal experience, as a lifter and personal trainer of 3+ years, a former fat person, and a former skinny guy, i really think anyone would enjoy this.

i hate the conception that you need to do 3 sets of every exercise. that’s not true. you can build muscle on 1 set, as long as you train intensely enough. our priority in this program is intensity; you’ll leave the gym feeling the right muscle every session—i promise. follow my instructions and cues and you’ll feel yourself making progress. i find myself performing worse when i know i have to do 3 sets of everything; i push myself much more when i only do 2 sets. because of our high volume, we’ll mainly do 2 sets of every exercise, but will train each day twice per week.

you may miss the standard heavy compound lifts, but we’ll incorporate those in variations (smith machine bench and squat, rdls, dips and pull ups) to make strength gains as well as muscle gains. i tend to stay in the 6-15 rep range, but if you want to focus on strength in a certain compound lift, you’re welcome to reduce the reps and increase sets. just make sure, above else:

the mike mentzer heavy duty training program,"the heavy duty training program, developed by mike mentzer, was designed to maximize muscle growth (hypertrophy) in the most efficient and effective way possible. 

mentzer’s program sought to optimize intensity, minimize workout volume, and maximize recovery to stimulate muscle growth without overtraining. his philosophy directly opposed the high-volume, frequent training regimens popular in bodybuilding during the 70s and 80s.

core purpose & objectives:
1. maximize muscle fiber recruitment
mentzer believed that training to absolute muscular failure would engage the largest number of muscle fibers. this point of failure meant pushing until no additional reps could be performed with proper form.

by doing so, the muscles would receive a powerful growth stimulus, eliminating the need for multiple sets or excessive volume.

2. minimize volume (efficiency)
mentzer saw high-volume training as counterproductive, often leading to overtraining and wasted effort.

his philosophy advocated for 1 intense working set per exercise, after appropriate warm-ups, to trigger the maximum hypertrophic response without exhausting the body's recovery systems.

3. focus on recovery (growth happens outside the gym)
mentzer emphasized that muscle growth occurs during recovery, not during the workout itself.

training too frequently or with too much volume prevents the body from fully repairing and growing the muscles.

his program recommended training only 2-3 times per week, allowing for 48-96 hours of rest between sessions.

4. progressive overload
mentzer stressed the importance of progressively increasing weight or reps over time.

each workout should involve a push to beat previous performance, whether through adding weight, reps, or using intensity techniques like rest-pause or negatives.

5. simplicity and intensity

the program was designed to be simple but brutally intense. mentzer aimed to reduce the need for complex routines and extended gym time.

instead, each session included just a handful of exercises, executed with extreme effort and focus.

slow and steady training method
although the exercises themselves were intense, each movement was meant to be performed with perfect form. for many people, this goes without saying. however, mentzer made sure to emphasize every single movement in an exercise with a full range of motion.

this meant taking 2 to 4 seconds on the way up, and the same amount of time in the downward motion. this may not seem like a lot, but for those of us who have gotten used to using our momentum in a lot of lifts, this seriously changes the difficulty of workouts.

mentzer took these principles and refined them into heavy duty training, believing that less was more when it came to building muscle. his goal was to offer bodybuilders a way to train smarter, not harder, and achieve exceptional results without spending hours in the gym every day.

the minimalist | 2-day/week bodybuilding program,"this is meant to be a bare minimum program. it allows you to hit all of the muscles in the body without spending a lot of time in the gym per week. 

you can run this program with as little as 2 days a week but if you have the time then doing 3 or 4 would be beneficial.

if you’re running it 2 days a week i suggest having 3 days between training sessions. if you’re training 3 days a week i suggest lifting monday, wednesday, friday then having the weekends off. adjust that spacing back or forward a day based on your individuals schedule.

if you want a high frequency approach you can train every other day alternating between a and b workouts.

rep range:
pick 5 to 10 reps or 10 to 15 reps. once you plateau on a rep range for weeks, rotate to the other.

supersets:
perform exercise 1 then 2 then rest. if you need to catch your breath between exercises you can, i don’t want you to have a heart attack mid session.

rest times:
90 seconds to 3 minutes per superset. if you’re out of breath to the point where you can’t perform well, take a bit longer. rest times are guidelines not rules.",['novice'],['muscle & sculpting'],full gym,1.0,40.0,6,2024-04-27 06:49:00,2025-06-18 11:54:00,4.666666666666667
the mississippi mule,"to increase strength and muscle stamina

designed for a young high level crossfit athlete who trains twice a day/ 5 days a week 

major lifts will progress from peak sets of 5s on week 1, to triples on week 2, to doubles on week 3, and max singles on week 4. at the end of these 4 weeks the athlete start over and repeat the progression aiming to hit higher peak sets. 

each strength session will involve absolute strength work (expressed in 5s,3s,2s, and 1s), and muscular endurance work (expressed in 10+ rep ranges). 

all muscular endurance work will include active recovery work. (learning to recover between sets while continuing in lower intensity work- such as run, bike, row, or ski ergs)

strengths sessions will be divided into 4 categories:
1.) lower
2.) push
3.) pull
4.) olympic weightlifting 

each week there will be two lower body days (one will have a squat focus, the other a deadlift focus)

each week will have 3 push days and 3 pull days 

push days will alternate between a bench focus and an overhead focus.

pull days are not programmed in detail here. these sessions will involve a variety of movements chosen by the athlete.
(the program will just say “pull-ups”; but the athlete, in these sessions, will need to pick from a variety of movements — muscle ups, rope climbs, all forms of pull-ups, etc) 

each week will include 3 olympic weight lifting sessions. barbell cycling with active recovery will be attached to then end of each strength session in these days.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate', 'advanced']","['athletics', 'muscle & sculpting', 'bodyweight fitness']",full gym,4.0,90.0,112,2024-05-23 11:50:00,2025-06-18 10:46:00,42.0

the sorcerer killer (toji fushiguro),"(ai) this workout plan is designed to get you closer to the physiques of toji fushiguro by focusing on hypertrophy, aesthetics, and functional strength. the combination of high-volume hypertrophy training with some strength work will help you:

increase muscle size (hypertrophy): the high-rep, high-volume sets are structured to maximize muscle growth, which is essential for achieving an aesthetic, muscular look similar to toji's athletic build.

develop core strength and definition: with core work integrated every day, you’ll build a lean and defined midsection, which is crucial for achieving that shredded, powerful appearance.

build functional strength: by incorporating exercises like deadlifts, squats, cleans, and farmer’s walks, you will also develop the raw, functional strength, while still emphasizing toji’s muscular and lean aesthetic.

what to keep in mind:
body fat percentage: to truly see the muscle definition that toji, your body fat will need to be low, likely around 10-12% or lower. achieving that shredded look requires careful attention to your diet and cardio alongside the workout.

genetics and frame: your genetic potential, natural muscle shape, and overall frame will also influence how closely you match their physiques. while you can make substantial progress, remember that their bodies are idealized and exaggerated. still, this plan will bring you much closer to a highly muscular and lean build.

diet and recovery: to support this intense training, you’ll need to focus on protein intake (about 1g per pound of body weight), enough calories to grow muscle, and proper recovery (sleep, hydration, etc.).

with consistency, the plan will allow you to develop a physique that balances muscularity, athleticism, and definition, resembling those anime characters as closely as possible in real life.","['intermediate', 'advanced']",['bodybuilding'],full gym,12.0,70.0,436,2024-10-01 09:18:00,2025-06-18 12:17:00,98.0

toji fushiguro top workout,"this program is designed to transform your body into a powerhouse of strength and athleticism while building lean, sculpted muscle. inspired by toji fushiguro from jujutsu kaisen, it focuses on explosive power, high-intensity training, and functional movements. whether you're looking to increase athletic performance or achieve an aesthetic, muscular physique, this workout combines bodybuilding principles with athletic drills that improve agility, speed, and strength. get ready to build the kind of physique that blends power, endurance, and muscle definition—just like your favorite anime character.

🧠 how to approach this routine
this program blends athletic training with classic bodybuilding, which means your mindset and execution should reflect both explosive intent and controlled precision. here's how to approach each aspect of the routine:

✅ 1. train with intention, not ego
focus on form first, especially with compound lifts and athletic movements.

explosive exercises (jumps, cleans, snatches) should be done with max effort and full recovery between sets. you’re training for power, not fatigue.

bodybuilding movements (like curls, presses, flys) should be done with control and tension, maximizing the mind-muscle connection.

🔁 2. follow the weekly flow
you’ll be training 5 days per week with wednesdays and sundays as your recovery days. these are perfect for:

low-intensity cardio (20–30 min walks, incline treadmill, cycling)

mobility work or yoga

breath work or recovery sessions if needed

🔼 3. progressive overload is key
every 1–2 weeks, aim to:

increase weights slightly (2.5–5 lbs is enough for most lifts)

add an extra rep to a set

reduce rest times slightly for more intensity

if you're stalling or overly fatigued, keep the weight the same but focus on cleaner reps or slower eccentrics.

🔄 4. use rpe (rate of perceived exertion) wisely
this program uses rpe cues to help guide your effort:

rpe 6–7: you should have 3–4 reps left in the tank. use this for warm-up sets or technical lifts (like cleans or snatches).

rpe 8: this means you’re working hard but cleanly—1–2 reps left in the tank.

rpe 9–10: only used for bodyweight amraps or final sets of accessories (like push-ups or lateral raises).

⚙️ 5. warm-up before every workout
a proper warm-up primes your cns and reduces injury risk:

5–10 minutes of light cardio

mobility work (hips, ankles, shoulders)

ramp-up sets of your first compound lift

on athletic-focused days, include dynamic drills: high knees, butt kicks, a-skips, and light bounding.

🧱 6. customize based on your equipment
if you don't have access to:

barbells: substitute with dumbbells or kettlebells.

machines: use resistance bands or bodyweight alternatives.

cable stations: use dumbbells or suspension trainers (trx) to mimic",['intermediate'],"['bodybuilding', 'powerbuilding', 'powerlifting', 'bodyweight fitness']",full gym,8.0,70.0,280,2025-04-09 03:23:00,2025-06-18 08:27:00,65.33333333333333

toji physique program,"the program focuses on the muscles of the upper body primarily - shoulders especially lateral delts, and back but also chest and arms. the lower body is still trained to avoid ridiculous muscle imbalances but relatively minimally.

it's a modified upper-lower split where you train your upper body 3 times a week and your lower body 2 times a week, ideally you would take a rest day after the second upper day and after the third upper day but running it continously for 5 days and taking 2 rest days in a row is possible.

most of the days consist of supersets for the sake of time efficiency, but if for any reason the superseting is not possible the exercises can be done separately, however the supersets were designed in such a way that it should be possible unless the gym is really crowded.

the volume is decently high, if you notice that you don't recover on time for the next workout feel free to decrease the number of sets. if you can take more volume of course increase the number of sets.

if you are efficient with your supersets the workouts should take about 1h if you're not they will take about 1,5h.",['intermediate'],"['bodybuilding', 'powerbuilding']",full gym,12.0,60.0,288,2024-11-12 12:56:00,2025-06-18 09:01:00,84.0

torso (push & pull) limbs (arms & legs) cardio. t rex to x.,"my legs are big enough. i want to grow my upper body and get my running stats up. 

time to recover from t rex body shape and get that x shape. 

exercise selection changes through the week. 
exercise order reflects what you want to grow. calves are an exception and they should be done first. easy to recover and don’t hinder other things.

push, pull, and abs are on the first day.
shoulders, triceps, biceps, forearms are on the second day. superset is recommended. 

cardio, legs and stretching (let’s get those splits done), and any lagging body part is on the third day. cardio tracks the minutes you can run for in a stretch. doing it for 30 minutes at 10 kmph will get you to a 5k run. don’t skip the warmup. 

important: go to failure if you’re small or are lifting small weights. sets as many as you can do between 2-5. reps don’t matter if you’re going to failure. but pick such a weight that lets you do 8-15 reps. eat well. hit protein. aim to gain 1-1.5 kgs every month for 6-8 months.  after that, lose 2 kgs a month for 2 months. and switch it up in the next two months. one year later you’re jacked and stacked.

go to failure or 0 rir on everything that won't decapitate or crush you if you do so. 

stick to a good standard of form without obsessing over it (at least a 2 second eccentric, 1 second pause at the stretched position, as big of a stretch as possible, explosive concentric, no hip involvement).

didn't include any rear delt work as, in my experience, they grow just fine without isolation, but you can add them as a superset to your ab work. i really enjoy skiers, meadows rear delt swings or the single arm cross body cable stuff.

in movements where it's safe, do lengthened supersets after failure, especially if they have shit resistance profiles (back work, incline curls, etc.) or just straight up do lengthened partials instead of full rom.

training regime (1.0) - sept 2024,"the purpose of this workout plan is to help you maintain a lean, muscular physique with a balanced focus on strength, muscle growth, and endurance, tailored to your specific preferences and goals. here's a breakdown of the key elements:

1. focus on key areas:
legs, arms, and shoulders are the primary muscle groups targeted for development, with an emphasis on building strength and muscle size while maintaining balance.
chest and back are maintained through consistent, moderate-volume training to ensure these areas stay developed without overwhelming the focus on legs, arms, and shoulders.
lower back strength is specifically addressed with targeted exercises like hyperextensions and machine-based back movements, ensuring spinal support and overall stability.
2. well-rounded workouts:
each workout targets 2-3 muscle groups, ensuring you build strength and muscle across all areas of your body.
8 exercises per workout day increase the volume, allowing for better hypertrophy (muscle growth) while balancing strength development.
each day ends with 15-20 minutes of cardio (stairmaster, spin classes, treadmill) to support overall cardiovascular health and aid fat loss.
3. customized preferences:
avoiding deadlifts, rack pulls, and traditional squats, the workout uses machine-based alternatives (hack squats, leg presses) and back exercises that fit your preferences while avoiding lower back strain.
active recovery day with abs and organized sports (or hikes) provides a day of light activity to rest muscles while keeping you moving and developing core strength.",['intermediate'],['bodybuilding'],full gym,8.0,120.0,328,2024-09-09 06:23:00,2025-06-18 08:05:00,112.0

transforma tus glúteos:programa para principiantes,"este programa está diseñado para el desarrollo de glúteos y piernas, ofreciendo una progresión fácil de seguir. está enfocado en mujeres principiantes en el gimnasio y también incluye ejercicios para otros grupos musculares del tren superior.

en esta rutina vamos a usar algunos conceptos clave de progresión  para que tengas un camino y objetivos claros y medibles de tu avance cada semana, a continuación los detallo: 

1. % de 1rm (repetición máxima):
el 1rm es el máximo peso que puedes levantar una vez en un ejercicio. trabajar con un porcentaje de tu 1rm (ej., 70%) te ayuda a ajustar la carga para que el entrenamiento sea desafiante pero seguro. ejemplo: si tu 1rm en sentadillas es 100 kg, entrenar al 70% significa usar 70 kg.

2. rpe (escala de esfuerzo percibido):
el rpe mide lo difícil que sientes un ejercicio en una escala del 1 al 10, donde 1 es muy fácil y 10 es el máximo esfuerzo. ejemplo: un rpe de 8 significa que podrías hacer 2 repeticiones más antes de fallar. esto te permite ajustar la intensidad del entrenamiento según cómo te sientas cada día.

3. dp (doble progresión):
este método te permite progresar en dos etapas: primero aumentando repeticiones y luego, cuando alcanzas el máximo de repeticiones (ej., 12), incrementas el peso. ejemplo: si haces 8-12 repeticiones, cuando logres 12, subes el peso y vuelves a empezar con 8 repeticiones.

4. ddp(doble progresión dinámica):
es una variación donde, además de aumentar peso o repeticiones, también puedes cambiar la velocidad de las repeticiones (más lentas o explosivas). esto te permite mejorar tanto la fuerza como el control muscular.","['intermediate', 'novice', 'advanced']","['bodybuilding', 'powerbuilding', 'athletics']",full gym,8.0,80.0,192,2024-08-26 08:18:00,2025-06-18 11:15:00,74.66666666666667
transforma tus glúteos 2,"este programa de 12 semanas está diseñado para desarrollar fuerza y masa muscular, especialmente en la zona de glúteos y  piernas, áreas que son prioridad en mujeres. se divide en dos fases de 6 semanas cada una, con una progresión de cargas y cambios en repeticiones para maximizar la ganancia muscular y la fuerza.

estructura del programa
fase 1 (semanas 1-6):
durante esta fase, el enfoque principal es la hipertrofia (aumento de volumen muscular). aquí trabajamos en rangos de repeticiones de 8-12 para ejercicios compuestos y de 12-15 en ejercicios de aislamiento. el objetivo es crear una base sólida en técnica, resistencia muscular y volumen.

fase 2 (semanas 7-12):
en esta fase, la meta es continuar desarrollando fuerza y tamaño muscular, con una orientación más intensa hacia el aumento de fuerza. las repeticiones se reducen a 6-8 para ejercicios compuestos y 10-12 para aislados, lo que permite levantar cargas más altas.

periodización y progresión

triathlon strengthening,"the program's primary purpose is not to build maximal bulk, but to strategically enhance your performance, durability, and efficiency as an endurance athlete.

key objectives:
1. preserve lean muscle mass: high-volume endurance training can sometimes lead to muscle catabolism (breakdown). these sessions provide the stimulus needed to maintain your existing muscle mass, ensuring you retain strength and power throughout your preparation.

2. develop functional, triathlon-specific strength: exercises are selected to strengthen the key muscle groups vital for all three disciplines. this includes:
- lower body power: for a stronger, more efficient pedal stroke on the bike and a resilient stride during the run.
- upper body strength & endurance: to improve your pull in the swim and maintain a stable, aerodynamic position on the bike.
- core stability: a strong core is fundamental for efficient power transfer from your limbs, maintaining good posture during long efforts (especially on the bike and run), and reducing energy leakage.

3. enhance injury resilience: by strengthening muscles, tendons, and ligaments, particularly around vulnerable joints, these workouts aim to reduce the risk of common overuse injuries associated with the repetitive nature of triathlon training. addressing potential imbalances and improving stability are key.

4. improve power output and efficiency: while endurance is paramount, strength forms the foundation for power. a stronger athlete can often produce more power with less perceived effort, leading to improved efficiency and speed, especially on the bike and during the swim.

5. support recovery and form: well-conditioned muscles can sometimes recover more quickly and are better able to maintain good biomechanical form even when fatigued, which is critical in the later stages of a long race.","['novice', 'intermediate', 'advanced']","['powerbuilding', 'powerlifting', 'bodybuilding']",full gym,4.0,60.0,64,2025-06-04 11:26:00,2025-06-18 09:23:00,28.0

core principles:
	•	heavy compound focus — squat, bench, deadlift run the show. accessories support, they don’t steal the spotlight.
	•	top set + backoff strategy — heavy top sets to push limits, followed by volume work to engrain movement patterns and build muscle.
	•	autoregulated load management — if the weight’s flying, you push. if fatigue creeps in, you adjust — but you never back off without a reason.

ultimate ulul + arm destroyer program (5 days),"your regular 4 day upper lower split but with a killer arm day (read to the end)

arm day is a bit different, here’s how you do it:
for every exercise, start with a failure set with a weight that causes failure at 12 reps.
then rest for 15 seconds and try to get in as many reps as possible. the program will tell you how many of these “effective reps” you need to get.
you can take 15 secs pauses between these ers, just make sure you hit the number specified.
example: for 20 ers, after a set of 12 reps, you can do something like : 5 reps + 15s rest + 8 reps + 15s rest + 7reps = 20 effective reps.

i'd advise a longer rest period on the upper lower sessions with the compound exercises (e.g. 2:30 mins)

upper and lower = free weights and primarily compound exercises, with a mix of rep ranges.

active rest day of zone 2 walking (45 mins - 60 mins)

push, pull and legs = machines, cables and isolation exercises

the program has supersets for isolations and all the important compound movements for strengh and mass gains. you can do this basic program indefinitely, or at least as long as you are progressing in terms of muscle mass and strengh.

adjust training volume as needed.

i recommend cardio training as well, i personally like biking. take walks preferably in nature as needed.

i recommend a high calorie diet with no or low sugar intake and enough protein.

take 2 to 3min rest in between compound movements. for the isolation supersets you can do them without rest or take rest as long as needed in beetween exercise to perform with maximal effort. always go to failure or beyond via dropsets.

victorian iron,"greek god gains is an advanced hypertrophy program designed to build a powerful, aesthetic upper body while maintaining balanced total-body development. this program emphasizes upper-body muscle growth through high training volume, strategic intensity, and intelligent progression. it’s ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters who want to sculpt a physique with a “greek god” aesthetic—broad shoulders, defined arms, and a dense, muscular frame.

at the core of the program is the double progression method—a structured approach where you aim to increase both reps and weight over time. each main lift or accessory movement is assigned a specific rep range (e.g., 8–12 reps). once you can complete the top end of the rep range for all sets with good form, you increase the weight slightly and repeat the process.

the training split emphasizes upper-body frequency, ensuring that muscles like the chest, back, shoulders, and arms are trained multiple times per week with varied intensity and rep schemes. lower-body and posterior chain work is included to support balance, posture, and overall strength, but without detracting from upper-body volume.",['intermediate'],"['powerbuilding', 'muscle & sculpting']",full gym,12.0,80.0,288,2025-05-13 02:45:00,2025-06-18 07:55:00,112.0
viking method - push/ pull full body,"this program is my personal program which i came up with after years of training an upper/ lower template. 

it is like a hybrid between an upper/ lower and an push/ pull/ leg split with the advantage of only training 4x/ week without the upper body days having too much volume, which is in my opinion the biggest downside of the upper/ lower split

on your push days you train every pushing muscle in the body: chest, shoulders, triceps and the quads. 
on your pull days you do the same but with the pulling muscles: upper back and lats, posterior chain, rear delts and biceps. 

in addition i find it really beneficial to super set your first big movement of the day with any calf exercise you like, as it does not interfere with your primary movement and this ensures you don’t skip it altogether 

in this version the 4 big movements are the movements that i find to be the best muscle builder out there, even though they are not the „standard“. 

smith machine squat
incline bench press
weighted pull ups
romanian deadlift 

i choose these movements because the give me the best stimulus for the targeted muscles while minimizing fatigue compared to the big 3. 
you can easily swap them out if you like to get an more powerlifting style training. 
again this is my way of training with the movements that i find to work best after years of trial and error 

i hope you find this split interesting and you might give it a try.

notes:

starting volume ist set low on purpose!
focus on quality and intensity in each set. 
go deep, with a solid pause and a controlled eccentric. 
if recovery is no problem, increase sets. 

progression:
- top sets on main movement of the day is rpe based. 
- back off sets and secondary movements are progressed via basic dynamic double progression 
- assistance and isolation exercises progressed via double progression. add intensity techniques if you like.",['intermediate'],['powerlifting'],full gym,5.0,60.0,145,2024-01-21 03:06:00,2025-06-18 09:27:00,35.0

women +40 build muscle and strength,"this program aims at aiding women +40 who are not professional athletes to achieve goals for optimal health and longevity. it is based on dr. stacy sims' science based approach, all backed by scientific literature, especially tailored to women's biology and performance.

for practical reasons on this app, i made the program 4 weeks, but it would be ideal to run it for 12!

it includes 2 sit (sprint interval training) sessions per week using a treadmill, but please look into this online, as you can also use an assault bike, rower, etc. also, i have put in 3 sets, but consider you should build up to 8. post menopausal women, instead, should stick to 3 sets but do it 3-4 times per week. 

in regards to choosing your weights for each specific exercise, consider that we aim at lifting heavy. this means you need to use a weight that will allow you to do 6-8 reps with good form, max. if you can do 9, you need to increase your weight. 

please make sure you research further, as there is nutritional advice and many other helpful pieces of info about how a +40 woman's biology works and how this affects her training routine when working towards optimal health and longevity. 

*note: the app offers some exercises but please consider that you can do them using different techniques, tools, and machines. for example, i have put in bicep curls with the cable, but you can definitely do them with dumbbells or even the bar. same goes for squats, rdl's, etc. just focus on the muscle group and adequate weight.

women's full body,"gaining muscle 💪 with minimal time investment.

tips/ explanations: 

-each workout is full body and includes a quadriceps, glute, and hamstrings exercise and for upper body one day is more push focused the other pull and last day is both.

1. start each excercise with 1-2 warm up sets in which you use the same rep range and form but with a lot lighter weight than the 3 working sets. 


2. 3x8-12 means you must 3 sets within the rep range of 8-12. to start pick a weight you can do for more than the minimum requirement but less than max of rep range. if you can't do the minimum rep requirement on each set the weight is too heavy. once you pass the top end of the rep range for each set you must go up in weight. especially in the lower body heavy sets. you must keep them heavy. so for example hip thrust 3x6-8, if you get 10,9,9 go up.

- rest times are 2min between the lighter sets. heavier lower body sets 3+ minutes. 

3. a + set is a very heavy set on squat or deadlift in which you will go to form failure and then stop. make sure to have safety. use the number of reps to recalculate your new one rep max going forward into the next week.",['novice'],"['muscle & sculpting', 'bodybuilding']",full gym,7.0,80.0,133,2024-11-26 03:29:00,2025-06-29 05:34:00,65.33333333333333

each week you should focus on increasing weight when appropriate in order to progress. for example, if you feel that you could do more than 6 reps with your working bench press weight, add 2.5-5lbs. if you feel you could do more than 12 reps with your goblet squat weight, add 2.5-5lbs. 

pick a weight that is challenging, but not impossible, for the respective rep ranges.

work in progress,"personal goals:

bench and oh press priority. put 20lb on bench (225total), put 10lb on oh press (140total), 20lb on squat (355total), maintain deadlift (405) and work on form.

starting off with decent amount of medium intensity frequency, working up to intense, heavy frequency. 

subbed front squat occasionally for rdls to ease volume on lower back as dls get heavier and to increase mass and volume capacity in quadriceps.

subbed bent rows and pendlay rows in and out to preserve erector recovery at tail end of cycle.

tapered general lower body volume as max testing approaches in the post-cycle week. hoping it will provide extra freshness for test week, reevaluate if not. 

keeping chest, shoulder, and upper back volume relatively the same because of higher recovery potential, reevaluate if not.

things to pay attention to:

progression on secondary movements… all secondary movements have a “0 rep” last set. this is intended to denote an auto regulating amrap. intending for these to help better adjust weekly undulation and balance higher effort on hypertrophy oriented exercises supplementing primary movements. if reps at set percentages of relevant 1rms exceed the amount used in previous working sets, you can better adjust the following week’s volume at the same weight or, the inverse, weight and the same rep count.

this is something i’d like to experiment with later on to see if i can determine an optimal intensity-volume ratio that lends itself better to hypertrophy/strength/both in my body individually.

i also intend on having another day a week that i train bench and oh press exclusively. usually i’ll use it to incorporate things like pin presses and dumbbell variations, but overall anything that gets more touches on bench and oh press.","['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate']",['bodybuilding'],full gym,5.0,120.0,164,2024-03-09 10:01:00,2025-06-24 06:49:00,70.0

block lasts for 3 weeks, after that add 5-10lbs to our maxes and 2-3 reps to pull-ups, repeat until done.

it is recommended to combine it with 2-3 high intensity cardio sessions between workouts.","['beginner', 'intermediate']",['bodybuilding'],full gym,3.0,90.0,84,2024-11-10 05:22:00,2025-06-18 12:22:00,31.5
[high testosterone] 5 day upper/lower/arms program,"this 12-week [high testosterone] 5-day upper/lower/arms split is designed to maximize muscle growth and aesthetics—especially in the arms and shoulders. whether you’re bulking in a calorie surplus or cutting/recomping, this program gives you structure and flexibility to adapt volume and intensity to your current goal. if you’re not in a surplus, consider reducing volume and training intensity slightly to avoid accumulating excessive fatigue.

muscle groups are trained with a smart weekly volume approach:
	•	arms & shoulders receive high attention (10+ direct sets/week), so you’ll look jacked even with a shirt on.
	•	compound and isolation lifts are balanced for maximum effectiveness across all major muscle groups.

supersets are included but completely optional. they’ll save time if you’re short on it, but you can always perform exercises on their own if you prefer.

you can choose whether to train to failure or leave 0–2 rir (reps in reserve) based on your recovery and lifting experience. rpe recommendations on each exercise, don’t feel limited by this however. push yourself, but train smart.

recovery is baked into the program with two active rest days per week, helping you stay fresh, mobile, and maintain heart health. these days are crucial—don’t skip the cardio!

this program is adaptable, i understand that training routines are highly personal and require a lot of time to tailor them to your own goals. please don’t be afraid to do your own experiments or change exercises, as long as they are similar to what i originally wrote. but, please don’t go above 4 sets on a given exercise, at that point the diminishing returns is too much.

finally, be on the lookout for trainer notes and personal tips listed under some exercises. these are cues and techniques i use myself to feel each movement better and improve long-term progression. 

weekly setup:

day 1 - upper push focus
day 2 - lower quad focus
day 3 - rest/active recovery
day 4 - upper pull focus
day 5 - lower hamstring focus
day 6 - shoulders/arms
day 7 - rest/active recovery

effort:
you need to put in some effort in training to see good results. both effort in how to train, being consistent, and preforming high intensity training in the exercises. try to stick with the rpe in the program, but if you know what you are doing you can go closer to failer or even farther if you know it's too much. but most people are farther from failure then they think. so just train hard and stick to it the best you can.
what is rpe?
rpe/rate of perceived exhaustion is a scale of how close you are to failing a lift.

anime revenge arc,"“they left you broken. now you rise—stronger, sharper, unstoppable.”

this isn’t just a workout plan. it’s a transformation story.
your arc. your comeback. your revenge.

over 18 brutal weeks, you’ll train like the main character of your own anime—facing weakness, failure, and doubt head-on, and crushing them under iron and discipline.

🧠 program structure:
phase 1: the foundation arc (weeks 1–6)
you build your base. clean form, moderate volume, controlled tempo. you become a student of pain.

phase 2: the ascent arc (weeks 7–12)
volume increases. sets get heavier. you push past what you thought were limits. you begin to move like someone different.

phase 3: the final arc (weeks 13–18)
intensity peaks. rest times drop. you operate with surgical precision. no wasted reps. no wasted effort. just war.

💪 training breakdown:
full-body training, 6 days/week

hypertrophy focused (8–15 reps)

rir-based intensity tracking (from 3 to 0 over time)

compound + isolation balance

push/pull/leg/core emphasis shifts across days

progressive overload built-in to every phase

each week, you hit:
chest, back, arms, legs, shoulders, core—again and again, until you’re unrecognizable.

🧬 backed by science:
full-body training boosts muscle protein synthesis

rir tracking prevents burnout and increases longevity

progressive overload ensures consistent growth

isolation work adds aesthetic definition

🔥 mentality:
no glory. no spotlight. just silent suffering.
you’re not here to impress—you're here to transform.

by week 18, they won’t recognize you.
by week 18, you won’t recognize you.

-week 9 days should be done back to back

-bodybuilding exercise can be done with a lil bit of body momentum just try to pack on as much mass as possible and should be switched out if you prefer another exercise just keep the spirt i.e. if it is a triceps movement don't hit quads duh. 

-rest liberally in strength and peak weeks you dont want to be under recovered and get beat up from the fat loads ;}

-foundation weeks can be done how ever just dont do to many workouts that prevent you from working the rest off the week take it slow but not to slow

-all lifts are just prescriptions for example if your back hurts on dead's or you can only low bar squat just change it but keep the formula if flat bench is not your thing change all flat bench main compounds to some kind of horizontal pressing do not change it with a vertical press and vis versa for ohp days. if you cant horizontal press (incline counts) or hinge (deadlifts rdls good morings etc) or vertical press (ohp seated press dumbbell press) or squat (safety bar high bar low bar any barbell squat in general) this program is not for you its not built for glass backs or pencil necks

~the formless nosferatu~ (5 days weekly a&b rotation),"a hypertrophy focused program with a utilization of a lot of different barbell , db , machines and bodyweight variation through weekly rotations (a & b) .. 
for tree trunk legs , huge thick traps and big arms & shoulders lovers (basically a tank) 
**not for people who want a slim shredded physique**

*(for the exact version i am using : https://alphaprogression.com/3ywlhx)

the program is hypertrophy focused but that doesn't mean u'll be glued to a machine because the ""sfr"" , rather it contains a bunch of ""athletic"" variations like high pull , front squat even hack deadlift.. yet it's well balanced with cables and machine work as well to manage the fatigue of each day and each weekly rotation ..

each day is *focused* on certain direction but without being a prisoner for it , so u'll find a calf raise in the arm day for example .. 

each muscle group is hit between 2-3 times , so expect the high frequency and start with the low end volume of 2 sets even 1 set if needed .

note that the program is heavily using giantsets & supersets .. however most of them is doable in a commercial gym as it would be using the same equipment.. for example : (curl , skull crushers , upright rows) all using ez bar .. 
(so it'll challenge ur work capacity , decrease in performance is expected at first then u'll adapt and save time and even increase performance and work density) 


the program also utilize the ""big 3"" to push progression but without being obsessed about them as u would do them biweekly.. like bench one week and dips the other .. but don't worry i got u covered as u would be doing another bench variation later in the week with other variations.. 

finally about progression , firstly u can choose ur own method , but any basic double progression would work and it's variations like rep goal system , evolving rep ranges .. or top set back off . etc etc 
but personally i am using and recommending an evolving rep range or rep goal with max safe reps on every set with the same weight .. 

lastly it's a 5 days program .. it has the flexibility of being run as u like whether 5 days in a row then 2 rest days or 2-3 days or whatever.. just keep in mind to take at least 1 day of rest between day 5 and day 1 of the next week .. as both of them are upper body days 


side note : 
a lot of the exercise selection has a specific reason behind it , so use ur best judgement if u want to swap a lift out .. for example : hack deadlift serves as a quad bias deadlift while still targeting the traps like the front squat from the other week ..
(however this is the exercises that i personally use)


***i wrote the specific variation i use in (...) if the variation doesn't exist in the app as i am not using the pro version yet***
